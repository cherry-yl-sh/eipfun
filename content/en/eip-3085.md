The purpose and functionality of the EIP-3085 proposal is to create an RPC method for adding Ethereum chains to wallet applications, allowing dapps to suggest chains to be added to the user's wallet application, with the wallet application having the ability to arbitrarily refuse or accept the request. The method accepts a single object parameter with a chain ID and some chain metadata, and returns null if the chain was added to the wallet and an error otherwise. The proposal also includes considerations for preserving user privacy.
