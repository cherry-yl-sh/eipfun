EIP-141 proposes the addition of a designated invalid EVM instruction, which can be used as a distinct reason to abort execution. The opcode 0xfe is designated as the INVALID instruction, which can be used to abort execution and duplicates as an ABORT instruction. This instruction was never used before and therefore has no effect on past contracts. The proposal aims to provide a more efficient and clear way to abort execution in smart contracts.
