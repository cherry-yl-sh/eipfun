## Summary

EIP-2544 proposes adding support for "wildcard" resolution of subdomains in the Ethereum Name Service (ENS). This would allow applications to issue ENS names for their users via custom subdomains on a shared parent domain, without the cost of setting a distinct record for each subdomain. The proposal adds an additional step to the name resolution process, which strips out the leftmost label from the name and derives the node of the new fragment, and supplies that node to the ENS Registry. If a resolver is located for that node, the client supplies the original, complete node to that resolver contract to derive the relevant records. This step is repeated until a node with a resolver is found. The proposal also defines a new way for resolvers to resolve names, using a unified resolve() method that permits more flexible handling of name resolution. While introducing an optional resolve function for resolvers increases implementation complexity, it enables many wildcard-related use-cases that would otherwise not be possible. The proposal recognizes the desirability of wildcard resolution for ENS, enabling more widespread adoption of the original specification by solving for a key scalability obstacle. Existing ENS clients that are compliant with EIP-137 will fail to resolve wildcard records and refuse to interact with them, while those compliant with EIP-2544 will continue to correctly resolve, or reject, existing ENS records.
