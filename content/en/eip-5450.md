EIP-5450 proposes the introduction of extended validation of EOF code sections to ensure that no stack underflow or overflow can occur during the execution of validated contracts. This is achieved by verifying that no exceptional conditions can happen and preventing the execution and deployment of any invalid code. The validation provides several benefits, including removing the need for run-time stack underflow checks for all instructions, removing the need for run-time stack overflow checks for all instructions except CALLF, ensuring that execution terminates with one of the terminating instructions, and preventing the deployment of code with unreachable instructions. However, it also adds constraints to the code structure and requires a second validation pass. The proposal poses no risk to backwards compatibility as it is introduced only for EOF1 contracts, for which deploying undefined instructions is not allowed, and the new instructions are not introduced for legacy bytecode.
