ERC-6224 is a proposed standard for managing smart contracts with their dependencies in the Ethereum ecosystem. It aims to make protocols upgradeable and reduce their maintenance threshold, while also providing a mechanism to audit dependency usage and aid larger composite projects. The standard introduces two concepts: the ContractsRegistry and the Dependant. The ContractsRegistry is a specialized contract for structured smart contract management, ad-hoc upgradeability provision, and runtime smart contract addition, removal, and substitution. The Dependant is a contract that depends on other contracts and uses a dependency injection mechanism to keep smart contracts' dependencies under control. The standard provides a unique address for all chains, solving the problem of resolving the correct registry address for different chains. The standard is simpler than previous attempts at defining pseudo-introspection in Ethereum and is fully decentralized. However, it must be used with extra care as the loss/leakage of credentials to the ContractsRegistry leads to the application's point of no return. Access to the ContractsRegistry must be granted to trusted parties only, and proper access control checks must be implemented for non-view methods of both ContractsRegistry and Dependant contracts. Overall, ERC-6224 aims to make Ethereum projects more manageable and maintainable in the face of increasing complexity and continuous delivery.
