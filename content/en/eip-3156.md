EIP-3156 proposes a standard interface for flash loans on the Ethereum blockchain. Flash loans are a type of loan that allows borrowers to borrow funds without collateral, as long as the loan is repaid within the same transaction. The proposal outlines the specifications for two smart contracts, the lender and the receiver, and the interfaces they must implement. The lender must implement the IERC3156FlashLender interface, which includes functions for determining the maximum loan amount and the fee charged for the loan. The flashLoan function in the lender contract must include a callback to the onFlashLoan function in the receiver contract, and must transfer the loan amount to the receiver before the callback. The receiver must implement the IERC3156FlashBorrower interface, and must approve the loan amount and fee to be taken by the lender before the end of the onFlashLoan function. The proposal also includes security considerations, such as the need for rate limits and overflow protection, and warns against unintended consequences such as treasury draining. Overall, the proposal aims to provide a safe and efficient standard for flash loans on the Ethereum blockchain.
