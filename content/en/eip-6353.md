ERC-6353 proposes an extension to the EIP-20 token standard that allows for automatic donations to a third-party charity with every transfer. The proposal includes a specification for how token owners can register charity addresses and set a default rate of donation, as well as how token holders can choose and specify a default charity address for the donation to be activated. The proposal aims to provide a standardized way of collecting and managing donations to charity organizations on-chain, making it easier for users and user interface developers to make an impact with their tokens and contribute to sustainable blockchain development. The proposal also suggests that this functionality can be used for automated savings programs. Implementation requirements include adherence to the key words and interpretations outlined in RFC 2119.
