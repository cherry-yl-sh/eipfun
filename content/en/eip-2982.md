EIP-2982 proposes Phase 0 of Serenity, a series of updates to Ethereum's consensus mechanism. In Phase 0, a proof-of-stake (PoS) chain called the beacon chain is built in parallel to the existing proof-of-work (PoW) chain, with the aim of achieving scalability and decentralization through sharding and economic finality through PoS. The beacon chain uses a PoS consensus mechanism called Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget (FFG) and a fork-choice rule called Latest Message Driven Greedy Heaviest Observed Sub-Tree (LMD-GHOST). The proposal focuses on the mechanics and incentives of validators executing these algorithms. The detailed specifications for eth2 are contained in an independent repository, and safety and liveness proofs can be found in the Combining GHOST and Casper paper. The proposal also addresses backwards compatibility and security considerations, including the risks inherent in migrating from PoW to sharded PoS. The proposal lays the groundwork for future backwards incompatibilities through the introduction of the new eth2 consensus mechanism, in which Ethereum will be integrated in subsequent phases.
