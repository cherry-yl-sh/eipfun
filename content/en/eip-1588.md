EIP-1588, also known as Ethereum ProgPoW, is an alternative hardfork for Ethereum that includes the ProgPoW algorithm as a replacement for Ethash. ProgPoW is designed to be "ASIC-resistant" and utilizes almost all parts of commodity GPUs, making it more accessible to a geographically-distributed community of miners with a low barrier to entry. The hardfork is activated at block >= 7280000 on the Ethereum mainnet and includes EIP-1057, which specifies the ProgPoW algorithm. The document presents an overview of the algorithm, examines what it means to be "ASIC-resistant," compares existing PoW designs, and presents the detailed implementation by walking through the code. The goal of the hardfork is to resist the centralization of PoW mining power and make Ethereum mining more accessible to a wider community.
