EIP-3234 is a proposal for standard interfaces and processes for multiple-asset flash loans, also known as batch flash loans. These types of loans are commonly offered by flash lenders and have a strong use case in the simultaneous refinance of several positions between platforms. The proposal outlines the specifications for two smart contracts, the lender and the receiver, which integrate using a callback pattern. The lender must implement the IERC3234BatchFlashLender interface, which includes functions for returning the maximum loan possible for each token and the fees charged for each loan. The batchFlashLoan function must include a callback to the onBatchFlashLoan function in a IERC3234BatchFlashBorrower contract and transfer amounts of each token to the receiver before the callback to the borrower. The proposal also includes security considerations, such as verification of callback arguments and flash lending security considerations. Overall, the proposal aims to provide independent but consistent standards for single asset flash loans and batch flash loans.
