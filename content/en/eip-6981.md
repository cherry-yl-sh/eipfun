The ERC-6981 proposal outlines a system for web services to link their users to a claimable Ethereum address, allowing users to receive on-chain assets without the need for on-chain transactions. The proposal deploys unique, deterministically-addressed smart contract accounts for each ERC-721 token via a permissionless registry, granting each token the full capabilities of an Ethereum account while maintaining backwards compatibility with previously deployed ERC-721 token contracts. Each token-bound account is owned by a single ERC-721 token, allowing the token to interact with the blockchain, record transaction history, and own on-chain assets. Control of each token-bound account is delegated to the owner of the ERC-721 token, allowing the owner to initiate on-chain actions on behalf of their token. The proposal also includes a standard interface for token-bound account implementations.
