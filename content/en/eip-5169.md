ERC-5169 proposes a way to store volatile data, such as token enhancing functionality, on an external resource to avoid costly updates to the script. This external resource can be hosted centrally, privately, or decentralized. The EIP allows the function ScriptURI to return multiple URIs, which could be a mix of centralized, individually hosted, and decentralized locations. The EIP does not dictate the format of the stored script, but it could contain pointers to multiple other scripts and data sources. The handling of integrity of such secondary data sources is left dependent on the format of the script. The EIP also addresses security considerations when a server is involved and when the scriptURI doesn't contain integrity information. Copyright and related rights are waived via CC0.
