EIP-2242 proposes adding an optional "postdata" field to Ethereum transactions, which allows for data to be posted on-chain but not read by the EVM. This is useful for trust-minimized side chains with fraud proofs, where the side chain block proposer attests that data is available and authentication can be performed as part of a fraud proof if the data ends up being invalid. The postdata field is an RLP-encoded twople consisting of a version number and binary data, with a gas cost of 1 gas per byte. The proposed changes are minimal and non-disruptive to the existing EVM and transaction format, and the new transaction format is backwards compatible. However, the changes will require a hard fork and cannot be implemented through a soft fork.
