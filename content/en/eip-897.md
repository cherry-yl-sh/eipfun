## Summary

The ERC-897 proposal suggests a standardized interface for proxy contracts that delegate their logic to another contract, which is becoming popular for smart contract upgradeability and creating cheap clone contracts. The proposal includes two functions: implementation() returns the address the proxy would delegate calls to at that moment in time, and proxyType() checks whether a contract is a proxy and communicates information about how the proxy operates. The proposal does not standardize any particular implementation of a DelegateProxy.
