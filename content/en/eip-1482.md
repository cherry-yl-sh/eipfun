EIP-1482 is a proposal to define a maximum block timestamp drift in the Ethereum protocol specification. Currently, there is a lack of clarity about how accurate timestamps in the block header must be, which can cause confusion and differing interpretations of what is considered a "reasonable" timestamp. This can create a risk of consensus failures. 

To address this issue, EIP-1482 suggests including an explicit definition of the acceptable timestamp drift in the protocol specification. Specifically, the yellow paper should define a timestamp as a scalar value equal to the output of Unix's time() at the block's inception, and for the purpose of block validation, it must be greater than the previous block's timestamp and no more than 15 seconds greater than system time. 

This proposal aims to establish a de facto standard for timestamp validation requirements, which is currently implemented by both Geth and Parity. By making this standard explicit in the reference specification, it can help prevent confusion and ensure that smart contract developers can safely use the TIMESTAMP opcode without risking consensus failures. 

Overall, EIP-1482 is a proposal to improve the clarity and consistency of timestamp validation in the Ethereum protocol, which can help ensure the stability and reliability of the network.
