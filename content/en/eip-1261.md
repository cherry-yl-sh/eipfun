ERC-1261 is a standard interface for Membership Verification Token (MVT) within smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. MVTs are non-transferable and revocable tokens that function like membership cards, allowing for the tracking of membership of individuals in certain on-chain organizations. The standard provides basic functionality for MVTs, which can represent proof of recognition, proof of membership, proof of right-to-vote, and other abstract concepts on the blockchain. The standard allows for several use cases, including automated compliance, various forms of governance and membership structures, passport issuance, social benefit distribution, travel permit issuance, driver's license issuance, investor permissioning, software licensing, and more. The assign and revoke functions of MVTs allow for interesting results, such as disallowing additional memberships after a condition is met, blacklisting certain addresses from receiving MV tokens, disallowing additional memberships after a certain time is reached, and charging a fee to the user of a transaction. The ERC-173 interface is used to manage the ownership of an ERC-1261 contract.
