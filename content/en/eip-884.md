The ERC-884: DGCL Token is a proposed Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) for creating an ERC-20 compatible token that conforms to the Delaware General Corporations Law (DGCL). This means that each token represents a share issued by a Delaware corporation and must adhere to certain principles beyond the ERC-20 standard. 

The purpose of this proposal is to enable the use of blockchains to maintain corporate share registries, which was recently explicitly allowed by the amended Title 8 of the Delaware Code Relating to the General Corporation Law. The ERC-884 token must provide functions of a corporation's stock ledger, including reporting, recording information about shares, and recording transfers of shares. 

One important aspect of the ERC-884 token is that token owners must have their identity verified, which is an SEC requirement for shareholders of a corporation to provide verified names and addresses. This is implemented through a proviso that causes transfers to fail if an attempt is made to transfer tokens to a non-verified address. 

The implementation of the ERC-884 token includes test cases and a reference implementation available on GitHub. The proposal also includes information on securities exchange commission requirements, the use of identity hash value, handling users who have lost access to their addresses, and permissions management. 

Overall, the ERC-884: DGCL Token proposal aims to provide a standardized way for corporations to issue and manage shares on the blockchain while adhering to legal requirements and providing security for shareholders.
