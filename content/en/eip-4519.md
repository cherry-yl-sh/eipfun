ERC-4519 is a proposal for a standardized interface for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that represent physical assets, such as Internet of Things (IoT) devices. These NFTs are designed to verify the authenticity of the tie between the physical asset and the token, and can include an Ethereum address of the physical asset, allowing it to sign messages and transactions. The proposal builds on the existing EIP-721 NFT standard, but includes improvements such as a user management mechanism that does not affect token ownership, and the ability for physical assets to generate their own Ethereum addresses in a random and secure way. The proposal also includes a mechanism for mutual authentication between the asset and its owner, and defines different states for the token depending on whether authentication has been completed successfully. The motivation for this proposal is to provide a secure and traceable way to manage smart assets, such as IoT devices, and to establish secure communication channels between the physical asset, its owner, and its user.
