ERC-3722: Poster is a proposed Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) for a simple social media smart contract that allows users to make posts and tag them with keywords. The contract takes two strings as parameters (content and tag) and emits those strings, along with the address of the user who made the post, as an event. The EIP also includes a proposed standard JSON format for a Twitter-like application, where each post() call can include multiple posts and/or operations. The assumption is that application state will be constructed off-chain via some indexer. The motivation behind Poster is to provide a base layer for decentralized social media that can be deployed to the same address on any EVM compatible network. Any Ethereum account can make posts to the deployment of Poster on its local network. The specification includes the contract code, ABI, and event details. The EIP is still in draft form and has not yet been accepted as an official Ethereum standard.
