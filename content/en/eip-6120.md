The ERC-6120 proposal is for a Universal Token Router (UTR) that enables tokens to be sent to application contracts in the transfer-and-call pattern instead of the approve-then-call pattern. The UTR separates the token allowance from the application logic, allowing any token to be spent in a contract call the same way with ETH, without approving any other application contracts. This saves users from having to approve unaudited, unverified, and upgradable proxy contracts, which can put them at serious security risks. The UTR is counter-factually deployed using EIP-1014 at a single address across all EVM-compatible networks, so new token contracts can pre-configure it as a trusted spender, and no approval transaction is necessary for their interactive usage. The UTR promotes the security-by-result model in decentralized applications instead of security-by-process. By directly querying token balance change for output verification, user transactions can be secured even when interacting with erroneous or malicious contracts. The main interface of the UTR contract includes the exec function, which takes in an array of actions and outputs, and the pay function, which allows for token payments to be made. Overall, the UTR aims to improve user experience, reduce costs, and enhance security in token transactions.
