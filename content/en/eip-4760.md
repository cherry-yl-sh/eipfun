## Summary

EIP-4760 proposes to rename the SELFDESTRUCT opcode to SENDALL and replace its functionality. The new functionality will only be to send all Ether in the account to the caller. This change is necessary because Verkle trees will make it impossible to remove all code and storage from an account in the future. The EIP also proposes to exponentially increase the gas costs of the opcode to give developers time to react and implement a version of their contract that does not rely on SELFDESTRUCT. The gas cost will double every 9 days, and SELFDESTRUCT will be converted to SENDALL at a specific block height. Applications that only use SELFDESTRUCT to retrieve funds will still work.
