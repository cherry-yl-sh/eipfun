ERC-4886 proposes a proxy ownership register that allows users to nominate a proxy address to act on behalf of another wallet address, along with a delivery address for new assets. This allows for trustless proof of ownership between Ethereum addresses and delegated asset delivery. Smart contracts and applications can use the proxy address to lookup holding information for the nominator address, which has practical applications such as storing valuable assets safely in a cold wallet and interacting with smart contracts using a proxy address of low value. The register also holds a delivery address, allowing new assets to be delivered directly to a cold wallet address. The proposal aims to eliminate exploits where users' assets are drained through malicious contract interactions and to make it easier for users to prove ownership of existing assets for various purposes such as Discord communities, whitelist events, and voting in DAOs. The standard is simpler and fully decentralized compared to previous attempts at defining pseudo-introspection in Ethereum, such as ERC-165 and ERC-672. Additionally, ERC-4886 provides a unique address for all chains, solving the problem of resolving the correct registry address for different chains.
