EIP-6988 proposes a change to the Ethereum network where the elected block proposer will not be slashed for including invalid transactions in a block. This is because the proposed EIP-1559 update will make it easier for block proposers to include all valid transactions in a block, reducing the likelihood of invalid transactions being included. The proposal also suggests considering multi-dimensional resource limits as a pragmatic way to achieve moderate scalability gains while retaining security. The backwards incompatible gas repricing requires a scheduled network upgrade, but users and miners will be able to continue operating with no changes except for a rule to stop adding new transactions into a block when the total calldata size reaches the maximum. Overall, the proposal aims to improve the efficiency and security of the Ethereum network.
