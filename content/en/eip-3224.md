## ChatGPT4

ERC-3224 is a standard that proposes a method for generating human-readable descriptions for machine-executable operations in Ethereum transactions. The goal is to provide users with a better understanding of the actions they are about to perform when signing or approving transactions. The standard proposes a contract method called eipXXXDescribe, which generates both the description string and the described data by evaluating the contract. This method can be used by dapp developers to enable a more comfortable user experience and provide wallets with a means to generate better descriptions of what the contract claims will happen. The standard does not address malicious contracts that may lie, but it assumes that transaction descriptions can be audited at the same time as contract code, allowing auditors and code reviewers to check that transaction descriptions are accurate as part of their review.
