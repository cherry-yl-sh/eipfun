ERC-5643 proposes an extension to the EIP-721 standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to include recurring, expirable subscriptions. The proposed interface includes functions for renewing and canceling subscriptions. The motivation behind this standard is to provide a common standard for subscription-based NFTs, which can be used for memberships, access passes, and other real-world applications. The standard will make it easier for users to manage their subscriptions in one place and for creators to generate recurring income. The proposal is currently in the peer-review process and includes specifications, rationale, backwards compatibility considerations, test cases, and security considerations.
