The ERC-5528 proposal adds refund functionality for EIP-20 tokens through an escrow smart contract. It allows for a type of escrow service where the seller creates an escrow smart contract with detailed information, and buyers fund their tokens which are pre-defined in the Escrow Contract. If the escrow process fails or is in the middle of the process, buyers can withdraw (or refund) their funded token. The motivation behind this proposal is to provide a solution for recovering funds that have already been paid in the pseudonymous world of cryptocurrencies.
