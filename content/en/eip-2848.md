ERC-2848 proposes a standard for creating a public, always updated, unstoppable, and verifiable message board using Ethereum as a certification layer for commands and multihash of messages. It uses simple self-send transactions with specific payload attached instead of smart contracts. The motivation behind MOM is to provide a decentralized way for developers, pool owners, and users to send and receive messages without relying on external social media sites. The standard includes security considerations for parsing commands and messages. A live client and a JavaScript package are available for testing and implementation.
