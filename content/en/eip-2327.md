The EIP-2327 proposal introduces a new opcode called BEGINDATA, which marks the remaining bytecode as data and indicates to EVM interpreters, static analysis tools, and chain explorers that the remaining bytes do not represent opcodes. This is useful for smart contracts that store data directly in the contract bytecode, as it distinguishes the data from normal bytecode and prevents it from being analyzed for JUMPDESTs by EVM interpreters. The proposal will not change any existing contracts unless their current behavior relies upon the usage of unused opcodes.
