EIP-2003, titled "EVMC modules for implementations of precompiled contracts," proposes a way to provide implementations of Ethereum precompiled contracts using the Ethereum Virtual Machine Connector (EVMC) VM API. This proposal is compatible with EVMC ABI version 6.

The EVMC module with implementations of precompiled contracts should advertise the EVMC_CAPABILITY_PRECOMPILES capability in the get_capabilities() method and implement the execute() method in a specific way. The method should validate the incoming execution request requirements, check if the call destination address targets an existing precompiled contract, and emulate execution of empty code if not.

The implementation should inspect the input data and calculate the gas cost of the execution, compute the amount of gas left after execution, and execute the code of the precompiled contract, returning the EVMC_SUCCESS status code, the output, and gas left.

The EIP also specifies that precompiled contract implementations are allowed to return two more EVMC error codes: EVMC_FAILURE for failures caused by something other than out of gas, and EVMC_REVERT if the precompile doesn't want to forfeit all supplied gas.

The client is not required to provide the Host interface, so the precompiled contracts implementation must not access the evmc_context. This removes a significant portion of work needed for full EVMC integration.
