The ERC-5185 proposal suggests an extension to the existing ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that allows for updatable metadata. This means that the metadata associated with an NFT can be modified after it has been created, without changing the underlying token itself. The proposal outlines a new "original metadata" field that can be included in the NFT's metadata, which serves as a reference point for any subsequent updates. 

The proposal also includes considerations for security and backwards compatibility. It warns of the potential for malicious actors to construct DDoS vectors using the original metadata, and encourages third-party marketplaces and tools to properly encapsulate software to prevent this. It also suggests that smart contracts should be careful when using this extension and allow for metadata URI updates in some contexts. 

Overall, the ERC-5185 proposal aims to provide greater flexibility and functionality for NFTs by allowing for updatable metadata. It is fully compatible with existing ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards, and third-party applications that do not support this extension can still use the original metadata for each NFT.
