The ERC-5630 proposal outlines a new approach to encryption and decryption using Ethereum wallets. One key motivation is direct-to-address encryption on Ethereum, allowing encrypted messages to be sent to a desired recipient on-chain without a prior direct channel. Another use case is encrypting a fresh secret to a public key controlled by the user, which can be stored securely on-chain. The proposal standardizes only the encryption procedure, not how the on-chain message should be sent. The proposal uses heavily standardized algorithms and follows best practices for security. The proposal can be cited as Firn Protocol, Fried L. Trout, Weiji Guo, "ERC-5630: New approach for encryption / decryption [DRAFT]," Ethereum Improvement Proposals, no. 5630, September 2022.
