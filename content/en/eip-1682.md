EIP-1682 proposes a new mechanism for charging rent on storage usage in the Ethereum network. The proposal suggests that users should pay a fee for storing data on the network, which would increase over time. The aim is to incentivize users to remove unused data and free up space on the network. The proposal also suggests reducing the cost of accessing storage slots 0-63, which would improve the performance of many existing contracts. However, the proposal requires a hard fork and would break backward compatibility, which could make some applications less economically viable. To mitigate this risk, the proposal suggests increasing the gas limit at the same time as implementing the EIP. The proposal also raises security considerations, as certain operations could become cheaper and result in a DOS vector if clients retain the same database structure. The proposal suggests adapting the database to make this work and separating the commitment scheme from data storage. The proposal also explores mitigations for contract breakage, such as the existence of an accessed_addresses and accessed_storage_keys map and the possibility of adding a POKE precompile or implementing EIP-2930. Overall, EIP-1682 aims to improve the efficiency and sustainability of the Ethereum network by incentivizing users to free up storage space and introducing a mechanism for charging rent on storage usage.
