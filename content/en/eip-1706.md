The EIP-1706 proposal aims to disable SSTORE with gasleft lower than call stipend in Ethereum. This is done by adding a condition to the SSTORE opcode gas cost calculation that fails the current call frame with an 'out of gas' exception if gasleft is less than or equal to 2300. The proposal is motivated by the danger of a new kind of reentrancy attacks on existing contracts due to the significantly lowered gas costs of writing to contract's storage in the EIP-1283 proposal.
