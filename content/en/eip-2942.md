The ERC-2942 EthPM URI Specification is a proposal for a custom URI scheme that can be used to identify EthPM assets within the Ethereum Package Manager ecosystem. This scheme allows users and tooling to easily specify a package, registry, or release with a single string, simplifying the steps required to install, publish, or distribute EthPM packages. The scheme includes a required "scheme" field, which must be either "ethpm" or "erc1319", and a "registry_address" field, which should be either an ENS name or a 0x-prefixed, checksummed address. An optional "chain_id" field can be included to represent the chain ID on which the registry is located, and optional "package_name" and "package_version" fields can be included to specify the target package and version. The specification also includes guidelines for safely escaping URL-unsafe characters in the package version. The need for this ERC emerged when refining EIP-681, and the proposal aims to maintain backward compatibility with EIP-67 URIs while allowing for future use cases and innovation. At the time of writing, there are no known security considerations for this specification.
