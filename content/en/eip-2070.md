EIP-2070 is a meta-EIP that specifies the changes included in the Ethereum hard fork named Berlin. The codename for this hard fork is Berlin, and the changes are currently being tracked and discussed in the eth1.0-specs repository. The purpose of this meta-EIP is to provide visibility and traceability of the scope of changes and to provide a simple name and/or number for referring to the proposed fork. Once the EIPs in the Accepted EIPs section have successfully launched on a testnet roll out, they are moved to the Included EIPs section. The Meta EIP representing the hard fork should move into the Accepted state once the changes are frozen (i.e. all referenced EIPs are in the Accepted state) and into the Final state once the hard fork has been activated. Overall, EIP-2070 is a proposal for the upcoming Berlin hard fork and serves as a guide for the changes that will be implemented.
