The ERC-5484 proposal introduces the concept of Consensual Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) which represent commitments, credentials, and affiliations of accounts. Burn authorization is tied to specific tokens and is immutable after issuance, making it important to inform the receiver and gain their consent before the token is issued. The proposal allows for maximum freedom when it comes to interface usage and provides flexible and predetermined rules to burn. The proposal is fully backward compatible with EIP-721 and allows for key rotations by burning the token and issuing a replica to a new address. There are no security considerations related directly to the implementation of this standard. The proposal can be cited as Buzz Cai (@buzzcai), "ERC-5484: Consensual Soulbound Tokens," Ethereum Improvement Proposals, no. 5484, August 2022.
