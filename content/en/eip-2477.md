## Summary

The ERC-2477 proposal defines a mechanism for verifying the integrity of token metadata documents fetched by clients. This is important because many token standards allow attaching metadata to specific tokens using URLs, which provide no guarantees of content correctness or immutability. The proposal introduces two functions, tokenURIIntegrity and tokenURISchemaIntegrity, for smart contracts to use in verifying the integrity of token metadata documents. The proposal is motivated by the increasing use of tokens to represent and provide access to assets off-chain, and the need for a standardized way to ensure the integrity of metadata associated with these tokens. The proposal is backwards compatible with existing token metadata specifications and does not introduce any compatibility regressions.
