ERC-5560 proposes an extension to the ERC-721 standard for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to enable multi-redeemable NFTs. This means that an NFT can be redeemed in multiple scenarios for either a physical or digital object, and maintain a record of its redemption status on the blockchain. The motivation behind this proposed standard is to provide a more versatile and flexible solution compared to existing standards, allowing for new possibilities for commerce use cases and breaking the limitation of one-time redemption per NFT. One use case for an NFT that can be redeemed multiple times in various scenarios is a digital concert ticket, where each redemption could represent a unique experience or benefit for the NFT holder. The specification includes details on the redeem and cancel functions, redemption flag key-value pairs, and metadata extension. The proposal also addresses backwards compatibility and security considerations.
