The ERC-6384 proposal outlines a specification for Sign-In with Ethereum, which allows users to authenticate themselves using their Ethereum accounts and ENS names for usernames. The proposal emphasizes the need for a human-friendly interface that is free of machine-targeted artifacts, and for adequate mitigation of security risks such as MITM attacks and malicious signing requests. The proposal also recommends the use of ERC-191 for signed data standard, rather than EIP-712, and includes guidelines for supporting internationalization. The proposal is open, non-proprietary, and has long-term viability, with no dependence on a centralized server except for those already being run by the application that the user is signing in to. The proposal also includes an added functionality to the contract with the "view" modifier, which cannot change the on-chain state and harm the existing functionalities of the contract. Wallet implementers are allowed to construct a custom Sign-In with Ethereum user interface by parsing the ABNF terms into data elements for use in the interface, while still adhering to the display rules outlined in the proposal. Overall, the ERC-6384 proposal aims to provide a simple, secure, and extensible solution for Sign-In with Ethereum that is easy for users to understand and implement.
