The ERC-4973 proposal suggests a standard API for account-bound tokens (ABT) within smart contracts. ABTs are non-fungible tokens that are bound to a single account and do not implement a canonical interface for transfers. The proposal defines basic functionality to mint, assign, revoke, and track ABTs. The motivation behind this proposal is the popular MMORPG World of Warcraft, where some items are intentionally taken out of the world's auction house market system to prevent them from having a publicly-discovered price and limit their accessibility. The proposal aims to create a similar system for non-fungible tokens in Ethereum, where the value of the token is based on the social costs related to completing a difficult task with friends and guild members. The proposal includes a Solidity interface, EIP-712 Typed Structured Data Hashing and Bytearray Signature Creation, and backwards compatibility. There are no security considerations related directly to the implementation of this standard, and the copyright and related rights are waived via CC0.
