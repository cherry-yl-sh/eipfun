ERC-1081 proposes a standard contract and interface for issuing bounties on Ethereum, which can be used for any type of task and paid in any ERC20 token or in ETH. The motivation behind this proposal is to encourage cross-platform interoperability of bounties on Ethereum and make it easier to track reputational metrics. The proposal outlines three core steps to every bounty: issuance, fulfillment, and acceptance. The initial version of the proposal had more restrictions, but the new version allows for more flexibility in terms of splitting funds among correct submissions, sharing submissions among contributors, and accepting payouts in multiple tokens. The proposal includes a reference implementation, but it has not yet been audited or bug-bountied, so its correctness cannot be guaranteed. Overall, ERC-1081 aims to standardize interactions across task types and facilitate the administration of funds in exchange for deliverables in a publicly auditable and immutable fashion.
