## Summary

ERC-5554 proposes an interface for describing and enforcing the legal use and remix of an NFT, including an on-chain registry of rights, attribution, and derivative links. The goal is to help the ecosystem reach clear consensus and broad understanding of what purchasers of NFTs are acquiring in terms of copyright or other rights. The proposal extends any other token standard to provide explicit rights for the token holder related to commercial exploitation, derivative works, and reproduction, as well as an interface for creating, viewing, and checking the status of licenses. It also includes a standard format for extended license information in the token metadata, standard events to track off-chain creation of derivative works, commercial exploitation, and reproduction, and on-chain tracking of derivative works and reproductions. Additionally, there are function calls for commercial exploitation, derivative works, and reproduction, and additional required fields in the smart contract to reference the copyright owner. Overall, the proposal aims to address legal uncertainty surrounding NFTs and provide a clear framework for the rights associated with NFT ownership.
