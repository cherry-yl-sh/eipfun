The EIP-6046 proposal suggests replacing the SELFDESTRUCT opcode with DEACTIVATE, which would change the semantics of account revival by preserving old storage items and requiring newly deployed code to be aware of this. The proposal also allows for account creation if the nonce equals 2^64-1 and notes that a successful CREATE2 will change the account code, nonce, and potentially balance. The EIP-6049 proposal deprecates SELFDESTRUCT and warns against its use, noting that a breaking change may be forthcoming.
