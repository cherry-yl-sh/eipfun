ERC-601 proposes a logical hierarchy for deterministic wallets based on BIP32, with a purpose set to 43 for non-bitcoin cryptocurrencies, a subpurpose set to 60 for Ethereum, an EIP number for the remainder of the derivation path, and a wallet component for different user identities. This is intended to address the confusion and incompatibility between wallet implementations caused by different derivation paths, and to better tailor the hierarchy to Ethereum's unique requirements.
