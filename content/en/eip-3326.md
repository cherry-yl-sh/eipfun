EIP-3326 proposes a new RPC method called `wallet_switchEthereumChain` for wallets with a concept of an active chain. This method allows users to switch between different Ethereum chains, but switching the active chain has significant implications for pending RPC requests and the userâs experience. Therefore, the proposal suggests that wallets should display a confirmation whenever a `wallet_switchEthereumChain` request is received, clearly identifying the requester and the chain that will be switched to. Additionally, when switching the active chain, all pending RPC requests and chain-specific user confirmations should be canceled. 

The proposal also emphasizes the importance of preserving user privacy and suggests that wallets should automatically reject requests for chains that arenât supported or have yet to be added by the wallet to avoid revealing which chains are supported by the wallet. Wallet implementers should consider whether this communication channel violates any security properties of the wallet and take appropriate steps to mitigate it. 

The proposal also includes guidelines for wallets to sanitize each RPC URL before using it to send other requests, store a default list of data for commonly-used chains to avoid phishing attacks, and return an error with code 4001 if the user rejects the request. 

Overall, EIP-3326 aims to provide a standardized method for switching between Ethereum chains while ensuring user privacy and security.
