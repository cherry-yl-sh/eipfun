## Summary

EIP-3238 proposes delaying the difficulty bomb in Ethereum to Q2/2022. The difficulty bomb is a mechanism that increases the difficulty of mining over time, making it harder to mine new blocks and slowing down the network. The proposal suggests using a fake block number to calculate the difficulty, which would delay the ice age by approximately 9.89 months. This would allow miners to continue mining on the legacy chain for another ten months, with block times of around 13-15 seconds on average. The delay is intended to give developers time to conclude the merge between Ethereum 1.x and Ethereum 2.0. The proposal is not forward compatible and introduces backwards incompatibilities in the difficulty calculation, so it should be included in a scheduled hard fork at a certain block number. It is suggested to consider this EIP either with or shortly after the Berlin hard-fork but not later than July 2021. Alternatively, it can be considered to activate this EIP along with EIP-1559 fee market changes in a bundle. There are no known security issues with this proposal.
