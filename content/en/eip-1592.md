ERC-1592 proposes a standard and interface for defining transfer rules in the context of ERC20 tokens and beyond. The proposal aims to enable the integration of rules with interacting platforms such as exchanges, decentralized wallets, and DApps, while improving reusability, gas costs, and contracts' memory footprint. The proposal also aims to highlight contract behavior and its evolution to ease user interaction with such contracts. The document proposes specifications for a standard of transfer rules and interfaces to both the rules and the rule engine, which was made to be inherited by a token but may have a much broader scope. Rules are meant to be as simple as possible to limit gas expenditure, and the engine executes all the rules defined by its owner on every transfer. Rules are deployed on the blockchain as individual smart contracts and called upon by the rule engine they were attached to. The proposal provides a unified basis for transfer rules and aims to address the transfer restriction needs of other EIPs as well.
