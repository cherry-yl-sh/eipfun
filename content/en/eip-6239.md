ERC-6239 proposes to extend the ERC-721 and ERC-5192 standards by introducing Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples to Soulbound Tokens' (SBTs) metadata. SBTs represent the commitments, credentials, and affiliations of accounts, and the addition of RDF triples in metadata captures and stores the meaning of social metadata as a network of accounts and attributes. This enables the ability to query and retrieve information across multiple sources, using inference to uncover new insights from existing social relations. The proposed standard provides a foundation for publishing, linking, and integrating data from multiple sources, and supports fair governance. Burn authorization is tied to specific tokens and immutable after issuance, and an Issued event is emitted alongside EIP-721's Transfer event. The proposal is fully backward compatible with EIP-721, and there are no security considerations related directly to the implementation of this standard. The purpose of the proposed standard is to manage social metadata on-chain in a trustless manner, describing social metadata in an interconnected way, making it easy to be exchanged, integrated, and discovered. The key concepts include RDF triples, SBTs, burn authorization, Issued event, and backward compatibility.
