ERC-4671 is a standard interface for non-tradable tokens, also known as badges or soulbound NFTs. These tokens represent personal possessions such as university diplomas, online training certificates, and government-issued documents. They are not meant to be traded or transferred and only serve as proof of possession or achievement. The standard provides a common interface for non-tradable tokens, allowing for more applications to be developed and positioning blockchain technology as a standard gateway for verification of personal possessions and achievements. A NTT contract represents one type of certificate delivered by one authority, and the data is kept off-chain for security reasons. The standard does not define any way to transfer a token from one wallet to another, and users must be cautious with the wallet they use to receive these tokens. The contract creator is responsible for ensuring that the URI returned by the tokenURI method is always available. Overall, ERC-4671 aims to provide usefulness through the blockchain and promote the use of blockchain technology for personal possessions and achievements.
