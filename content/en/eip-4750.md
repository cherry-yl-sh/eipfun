EIP-4750, titled "EOF - Functions," proposes the introduction of two new EVM instructions, CALLF and RETF, to allow multiple code sections in EOF-formatted bytecode, each representing a separate subroutine or function. The motivation behind this proposal is to facilitate separate sections for functions with CALLF and RETF instructions.

The proposal specifies that for each of these instructions, if the code is legacy bytecode, all of these instructions result in an exceptional halt. If the code is valid EOF1, CALLF and RETF have specific execution rules. CALLF calls a function, and RETF returns from a function. The document also introduces a new execution state in EVM and a type section for functions.

The rationale behind this proposal is to introduce the ability to have several code sections in EOF-formatted bytecode, each one representing a separate subroutine or function. This change poses no risk to backward compatibility, as it is introduced only for EOF1 contracts, for which deploying undefined instructions is not allowed. The new instructions are not introduced for legacy bytecode. The test cases, reference implementation, and security considerations are yet to be determined.
