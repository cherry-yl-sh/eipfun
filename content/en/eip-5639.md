ERC-5639 proposes the Delegation Registry, a protocol and ABI definition that allows users to link one or more delegate wallets to a vault wallet in a way that enables the delegate wallets to prove control and asset ownership of the vault wallet. This is useful for proving ownership of assets to third-party applications in the Ethereum ecosystem without giving them root access to the main wallet, which is both insecure and inconvenient. The current method of signing payloads of data with the wallet itself can be inconvenient if the wallet is controlled via a hardware wallet or a multi-sig. The Delegation Registry allows for vault, contract, or token level delegation and on-chain enumeration. It is currently in the process of being peer-reviewed, and interested parties can participate in the discussion using the provided link.
