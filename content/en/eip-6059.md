The ERC-6059 proposal introduces a new inter-NFT relationship and interaction by allowing for Nestable Non-Fungible Tokens with emphasis on parent token's control over the relationship. It establishes the framework for the parent-child relationships of NFTs, where a parent token is the one that owns another token and a child token is a token that is owned by another token. The proposal allows for different collections to inter-operate, meaning that nesting is not locked to a single smart contract, but can be executed between completely separate NFT collections. The propose-accept and parent governed patterns allow for a more secure use, and the backward compatibility is only added for ERC-721, allowing for a simpler interface.
