ERC-6662 proposes a new IAccountMetadata interface as an extension for ERC-4337 to store authentication data on-chain to support a more user-friendly authentication model. With this new interface, users can store authentication data on-chain through one-time publishing, allowing dApps to proactively fetch it from the chain to support a more flexible and user-friendly authentication model. In the new authentication workflow, users use AA compatible smart contract accounts as their wallet addresses. Authenticator could be anything but holding the private key to sign usersâ operations. Relay is an online service responsible for forwarding requests from dApps to the Authenticator. If the authenticator is online, it can play the role of Relay service and listen to dApps directly. To enable the new authentication workflow, dApp needs to know two things: Where is the authenticator? This is solved by the relayURI field in struct AuthenticationInfo. Users can publish the uri as the account metadata which will be pulled by dApp to do service discovery.
