The ERC-1922 zk-SNARK Verifier Standard is a draft proposal for a standard way of verifying zk-SNARK proofs on the Ethereum blockchain. zk-SNARKs are a type of zero-knowledge proof that allow for private transactions on a public blockchain. The standard defines a set of functions and data structures that a verifier contract must implement in order to be compatible with other contracts that use the standard. This allows for interoperability between different zk-SNARK applications on the Ethereum network. The standard also includes guidelines for security and gas optimization. However, the referenced code is not yet ready for production use and needs to be updated. The standard is part of a larger set of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) that define various standards and protocols for the Ethereum network, including the ERC-20 Token Standard and the Ethereum Name Service (ENS).
