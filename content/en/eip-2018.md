ERC-2018 proposes a new token standard called Clearable Token, which allows for off-chain checks to be performed on transfers to comply with legal requirements such as KYC and AML. The clearing process involves a clearing agent who decides whether a transfer can be executed or not, and the amount to be transferred is not deducted from the payer's balance but is also not available for another transfer until it is executed. The proposal includes three actors: the clearing agent, the operator (an account approved to order clearable transfers on behalf of another account), and the orderer (the account that orders the transfer). The Clearable Token interface includes an enum for different transfer statuses and a function for ordering transfers with a string parameter for additional information on why a transfer may be cancelled. The motivation behind this proposal is to provide a solution for regulated tokens to comply with legal requirements while still allowing for efficient and secure transfers on the Ethereum network.
