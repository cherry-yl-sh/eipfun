The EIP-1474 proposal aims to standardize the remote procedure call (RPC) methods that Ethereum nodes should implement. Currently, there is no formal Ethereum RPC specification, which leads to inconsistent and incompatible RPC methods across different Ethereum clients. This proposal defines a set of RPC methods that should be implemented by all Ethereum nodes to provide developers with a predictable Ethereum RPC interface regardless of the underlying node implementation. 

The proposal uses the JSON-RPC protocol, which is a stateless, lightweight protocol that uses JSON as its data format. It also defines error codes that should be included in the response object if an Ethereum RPC method encounters an error. 

The rationale behind this proposal is to provide a reliable and predictable developer experience for Ethereum applications. The lack of a formal Ethereum RPC specification forces applications to work around method inconsistencies to maintain compatibility with various Ethereum RPC implementations. This proposal aims to standardize the RPC interface in a versionable and modifiable way through the traditional EIP process. 

The proposal impacts both Ethereum client developers and downstream dapp developers. Ethereum client developers are required to adhere to this specification when exposing RPC interfaces, while dapp developers are required to make RPC calls according to this specification. 

Overall, the EIP-1474 proposal aims to improve the developer experience for Ethereum applications by standardizing the RPC interface across different Ethereum clients.
