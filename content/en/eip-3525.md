## Summary

EIP-3525 proposes the creation of a semi-fungible token that combines the quantitative features of ERC-20 tokens with the qualitative attributes of ERC-721 tokens. This would solve the drawbacks of both types of tokens, as ERC-20 tokens require the creation of separate contracts for each data structure and ERC-721 tokens lack quantitative features. The semi-fungible token would be backwards-compatible with ERC-721, allowing for faster adoption and utilization of existing infrastructures. The specification requires that every ERC-3525 compliant contract implements the ERC-3525, ERC-721, and ERC-165 interfaces. The document also includes definitions for keywords such as "MUST" and "SHOULD" to ensure consistent interpretation. The proposal addresses the need for a more intuitive and straightforward way to control digital assets in crypto and could have significant implications for the management and transfer of financial instruments such as bonds, insurance policies, and vesting plans.
