The ERC-2520 proposal suggests adding support for multiple contenthash records on a single ENS name. Currently, ENS domains can only store one contenthash record, which means that site owners have to choose which hosting system to use. However, with the increasing number of ENS-compatible hosting systems available, lack of support for multiple records could become problematic. The proposal suggests adding new public interfaces for setting and getting contenthash records, which would allow for multiple records to be stored and retrieved based on the requested type. Additionally, resolvers that support multiple contenthash records would need to return true for a specific interface ID. Applications using ENS contenthash records are encouraged to handle them in a specific way.
