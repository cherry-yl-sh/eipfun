EIP-3030 defines a HTTP API standard for a BLS remote signer, which is used by validator clients to sign block proposals and attestations in the context of Ethereum 2.0. Validator clients contribute to the consensus of the Eth2 blockchain by signing proposals and attestations of blocks using a BLS private key, which must be available to the client at all times. The BLS remote signer API is designed to provide a more secure avenue for storing BLS12-381 private keys, enabling validator clients to run in more permissive and scalable environments. The specification includes three endpoints: GET /upcheck, GET /keys, and POST /sign/:identifier. The API is designed to be simple and follows the UNIX philosophy. The motivation for this EIP is that Eth2 utilizes BLS12-381 signatures, and the specification does not provide a directive on where the BLS private key should be stored. The EIP provides guidelines for implementing security considerations, such as uploading keys using a secure channel, preventing physical access to the node running the remote signer, and implementing IP filtering or rate limiting to prevent DoS attacks. The EIP also includes test cases and implementation details.
