The ERC-6551 proposal suggests granting ERC-721 tokens the ability to act as agents on-chain by deploying unique, deterministically-addressed smart contract accounts for each ERC-721 token via a permissionless registry. Each token bound account is owned by a single ERC-721 token, allowing the token to interact with the blockchain, record transaction history, and own on-chain assets. Control of each token bound account is delegated to the owner of the ERC-721 token, allowing the owner to initiate on-chain actions on behalf of their token. The proposal uses EIP-155 chain IDs to identify ERC-721 tokens along with their contract address and token ID, allowing smart contract authors to optionally support multi-chain token bound accounts. The proposal is designed to be maximally backwards compatible with existing non-fungible token contracts and does not extend the ERC-721 standard. The system outlined in the proposal has two main components: a permissionless registry for deploying token bound accounts and a standard interface for token bound account implementations. The proposal uses ERC-1167 minimal proxies to deploy each token bound account, allowing for compatibility with existing infrastructure and flexibility for custom token bound account implementations.
