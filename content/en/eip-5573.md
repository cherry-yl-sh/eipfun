ERC-5573 proposes a mechanism called ReCaps on top of Sign-In with Ethereum (SIWE) to give informed consent to authorize a Relying Party to exercise certain scoped capabilities. SIWE describes how Ethereum accounts authenticate with off-chain services, but there is no canonical way for the authenticated Ethereum account to authorize a relying party to interact with a third-party service on behalf of the Ethereum account. ReCaps introduces a mechanism that allows the service (or more generally a Relying Party) to combine authentication and authorization while preserving security and optimizing UX. The proposal aims to reduce user friction, onchain state, and increase security by introducing informed consent and deterministic capability objects on top of SIWE. The proposal also includes guidelines for wallet implementers to construct a custom Sign-In With Ethereum user interface and supporting internationalization. The proposal follows existing practices, is simple to implement, secure, human-friendly, and machine-readable. It also has facilities and guidelines for adequate mitigation of Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, replay attacks, and malicious signing requests. The proposal uses ERC-191 (Signed Data Standard) over EIP-712 (Ethereum typed structured data hashing and signing) and references other related proposals such as EIP-2525 (ENSLogin).
