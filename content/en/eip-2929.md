EIP-2929 proposes an increase in the gas cost for storage reading opcodes in order to address the issue of denial-of-service attacks that have shown these opcodes to be under-priced relative to other opcodes. The concern is that such opcodes will be the easiest known mechanism to degrade network performance via transaction spam. The proposal aims to target a limit of 8 MB of data that needs to be read in order to process a block and includes an estimate of 500 bytes for a Merkle proof for SLOAD and 1000 for an account. The proposal adds a flat penalty of 300 gas on top of the costs calculated in the table to account for the cost of loading the code. The risks associated with the proposal can be mitigated by the existence of an accessed_addresses and accessed_storage_keys map, which makes some cases recoverable, and by adding a POKE precompile or EIP-2930, which would have a similar effect to POKE but is more general. Overall, the proposal aims to address the issue of under-priced storage reading opcodes and mitigate the risks associated with it.
