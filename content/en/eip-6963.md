EIP-6963 proposes a new discovery mechanism for Ethereum providers (EIP-1193) that supports discovering multiple injected wallet providers in a web page using Javascript's window events. Currently, wallet providers that offer browser extensions must inject their Ethereum providers into the same window object window.ethereum, which creates conflicts for users that may install more than one browser extension. This results in a degraded user experience and increases the barrier to entry for new browser extensions as users are forced to only install one browser extension at a time. The proposed solution is to use window events to announce injected wallet providers, allowing for multiple providers to coexist without conflicts. This would improve the user experience and increase interoperability between wallet providers. The proposal includes a specification for provider info, provider detail, and window events, as well as interfaces, identifiers, images/icons, and events. The proposal also addresses backwards compatibility and includes a reference implementation for wallet providers and the Ethereum library. Overall, EIP-6963 aims to improve the user experience and increase interoperability between wallet providers by providing a new discovery mechanism for Ethereum providers.
