The proposed PAY opcode in EIP-5920 is a new opcode that allows for the transfer of ether to an address without calling any of its functions. It aims to improve the functionality and efficiency of the Ethereum network by addressing issues with the current method of sending ether, such as reentrancy attack vectors and DoS vectors, and the needlessly expensive CALL opcode for simple ether transfers. The PAY opcode is a dedicated opcode for ether transfers that solves these issues and is a useful addition to the EVM.
