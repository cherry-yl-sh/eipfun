The ERC-3668 proposal outlines a mechanism called CCIP Read that allows smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain to fetch external data offchain in a secure and transparent way. This is useful for minimizing storage and transaction costs on the blockchain. The proposal provides a common specification for fetching offchain data, which enables new applications that can operate without knowing about the underlying storage details of the contracts they interact with. The proposal outlines a three-step process for answering a query via CCIP Read, which involves querying the contract, querying the gateway using the URL provided by the contract, and querying or sending a transaction to the contract using the data from the previous steps. The proposal also specifies the contract interface and provides guidelines for security considerations. Overall, the proposal aims to provide a universal standard for offchain data retrieval that can be used by multiple end-users with different data storage and availability solutions.
