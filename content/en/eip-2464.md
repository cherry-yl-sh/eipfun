EIP-2464 proposes a new eth network protocol, eth/65, that introduces three new messages to address the issue of inefficient transaction propagation. The current protocol only allows for broadcasting transactions, which results in significant bandwidth waste when nodes need to transfer the same transaction multiple times to different peers. The new protocol introduces a way to announce and retrieve transactions, allowing for more efficient propagation and deduplication. The three new messages are NewPooledTransactionHashes, GetPooledTransactions, and PooledTransactions. NewPooledTransactionHashes announces new transactions to peers, GetPooledTransactions requests a list of transactions from a peer, and PooledTransactions responds with a list of transactions. By using these messages, nodes can avoid transferring the same transaction multiple times and can deduplicate transactions remotely. The proposal also suggests using a recently-included-transactions trick to discard stale announcements and keeping Transaction and PooledTransactions as separate messages to maintain protocol flexibility. The proposal does not change the consensus engine and can be rolled out without client coordination since devp2p supports running multiple versions of the same wire protocol side-by-side. The proposal does not have any security considerations and the copyright and related rights are waived via CC0.
