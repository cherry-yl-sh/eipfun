EIP-2718 proposes a new transaction format that allows for multiple transaction types to be included in a single transaction. This is achieved by introducing a new envelope structure that wraps around the existing transaction data. The envelope includes a type field that specifies the type of transaction being included, as well as any additional data required by that transaction type. This allows for more flexibility in the types of transactions that can be included in a block, as well as enabling new features such as atomic swaps and cross-chain transactions. The proposal also includes changes to the transaction validation process to ensure that only valid transaction types are included in a block. Overall, EIP-2718 aims to improve the efficiency and functionality of the Ethereum network by introducing a more flexible and extensible transaction format.
