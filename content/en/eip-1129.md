## Summary

The ERC-1129 proposal aims to standardize the way DAPP developers and service providers announce changes or updates to their services on the Ethereum network. It defines a format for posting announcements and removing them, as well as posting permissions and a human-friendly interface. The proposal includes two structures: Announcer, which stores information about the announcement maker, and Announcement, which stores information about the individual announcement. The proposal also includes a method to retrieve the number of active announcements. The motivation behind the proposal is to provide guidelines for notifying users of service status and to increase the quality of service provided by DAPP developers and service providers. The proposal is meant to be deployed as a Solidity smart contract on the Ethereum network.
