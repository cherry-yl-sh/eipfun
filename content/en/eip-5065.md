EIP-5065, titled "Instruction for transferring ether," proposes a new instruction for transferring ether to a destination address without handing over the execution flow to it. This is motivated by the architectural principle that execution flow should never be handed over to an untrusted contract. Currently, Ethereum does not have an ideal way to transfer ether without transferring the execution flow. The only existing method involves creating a dummy contract, sending the precise amount of ether to it, and then calling SELFDESTRUCT from it.

The proposed solution is to introduce a new instruction, AIRDROP, that transfers ether to the destination without making a call to it. The total gas cost would be the sum of a static cost, address access cost, and value to empty account cost. This instruction allows contracts to safely pass ether to an untrusted address without worrying about reentrancy or other malicious actions an untrusted contract can do.

This EIP does not affect any old instructions and does not break any valid assumptions, hence it is backward compatible. The document also mentions that there are no known security risks associated with this proposal.
