The EIP-2666 proposal suggests repricing certain precompiles and the Keccak256 function in Ethereum to better reflect their performance, consumed resources, and changes in the EVM. New price formulas are proposed for the SHA256 precompile, RIPEMD precompile, and KECCAK256 opcode, based on benchmarks and the inner structure of the hash functions. The proposal also takes into account the changes introduced by EIP-2046, which affects the cost of precompiles.
