EIP-3336 proposes changing the memory model for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to use pagination. Currently, the EVM charges for memory as a linear array starting at address 0 and extending to the highest address that has been read from or written to. This suffices for simple uses, but means that compilers have to generate programs that use memory compactly, which leads to wasted gas with reallocation of memory elements, and makes some memory models such as separate heap and stack areas impractical. 

The proposed change to a page-based billing model adds minimal complexity to implementations, while providing for much more versatility in EVM programs. Memory is now allocated in pages of 2**PAGE_BITS bytes each, with the most significant 256 - PAGE_BITS bits of each memory address denoting the page number, while the least significant PAGE_BITS bits of the memory address denote the location in the page. Pages are initialized to contain all zero bytes and allocated when the first byte from a page is read or written.

The EIP also defines a new memory cost function based on the number of allocated pages, with changes to memory expansion gas cost, MLOAD and MSTORE, and other memory-touching opcodes. Loading a word from memory or storing a word to memory requires instantiating any pages that it touches that do not already exist, with the resulting gas cost as described above. 

Overall, the proposed change to a page-based billing model for memory allocation in the EVM provides more flexibility to compilers targeting the EVM, while reducing wasted gas with reallocation of memory elements.
