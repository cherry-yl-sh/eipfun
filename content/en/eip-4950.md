The ERC-4950 proposal suggests an extension to the ERC-721 standard for non-fungible tokens in Ethereum, where two tokens are minted together and are entangled. This means that only one transfer is possible for the two tokens, and they are tied together. The proposal aims to provide an easy way to share a wallet through NFTs, where buying an NFT in a marketplace gives the buyer access to a given wallet. The use case for this proposal is to keep contact between an artist and a buyer of its NFTs, where the artist creates two entangled tokens A and B, keeps A, and transfers B to the buyer. By construction of entangled tokens, only one transfer is possible for them, thus the artist proves they have been the creator of the digital piece of art by sending a transaction to A that is visible from B. The proposal suggests that these applications of entangled tokens could be useful for NFT authorship/art creation and distribution of royalties by the creator.
