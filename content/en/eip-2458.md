EIP-2458 adds two new header options, updates and updated-by, to active EIPs. These headers are used to update active EIPs in a modular way, similar to how EIPs in final status are replaced by new EIPs. The updated header, which indicates the date an EIP has received an update, is reserved for EIPs in draft or active status. The updates and updated-by headers should be included in the frontmatter of active EIPs and should reference the EIP designation. Multiple EIP designations can be referenced, separated by a comma. These headers are optional and do not introduce compatibility issues or technical security issues. An implementation is adding a header option. The syntax of these headers should align with previous EIP header syntax. The document also includes a citation for proper referencing.
