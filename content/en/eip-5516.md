ERC-5516 proposes a standard interface for non-fungible double signature Soulbound multi-tokens, which are non-transferable after the initial transfer. This design allows for the recycling of SBTs and allows for batch token transfers, saving on transaction costs. It is partially compatible with EIP-1155 and allows for the mixing of multiple fungible or non-fungible token types in a single contract. The SBTs have multiple owners and are semi-fungible, making them suitable for applications such as academic degrees, code audits, and POAPs. The proposal includes specifications for double signature, metadata, guaranteed log trace, exception handling, and the batchTransfer function. It is fully backward compatible with EIP-721 and has no security considerations related directly to its implementation.
