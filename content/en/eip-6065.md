ERC-6065 is a proposal for a new token standard that allows physical real estate and property to exist on the blockchain. It builds off of the ERC-721 standard and adds important functionality necessary for representing real-world assets such as real estate. The three objectives this standard aims to meet are: universal transferability of the NFT, private property rights attached to the NFT, and atomic transfer of property rights with the transfer of the NFT. The token contains a hash of the operating agreement detailing the NFT holderâ€™s legal right to the property, unique identifiers for the property, a debt value and foreclosure status, and a manager address. The motivation behind this proposal is to lower barriers to entry, minimize transaction costs, reduce information asymmetry, make ownership structures more malleable, and create a new building block for innovation. The proposal inherits the ERC-721 NFT token standard for all transfer and approval logic and also inherits the ERC-721 Metadata standards for name, symbol, and metadata URI lookup. The proposal includes a Solidity interface and a legal structure implementation for property tokenization in the U.S. While a token that implements this standard must have a legal entity to conduct the off-chain dealings for the property, this implementation is not mandatory. The primary objective of this proposal is to create an NFT representation of physical real estate that is universally transferable while maintaining private property rights attached to the NFT and atomic transfer of property rights with the transfer of the NFT.
