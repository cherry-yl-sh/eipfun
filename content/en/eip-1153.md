EIP-1153 proposes the addition of two new opcodes, TLOAD and TSTORE, for manipulating state in Ethereum smart contracts. This state, called transient storage, behaves identically to storage but is discarded after every transaction, making it cheaper since it never requires disk access. The motivation for this proposal is to provide a gas-efficient solution for inter-frame communication in nested frames of execution, where contracts can be re-entered during the same transaction. Currently, communication via inputs/outputs passed via CALL instructions is not secure if there is an intermediate frame belonging to another untrusted contract, and communication via storage updates is costly. Transient storage provides a dedicated and gas-efficient solution to this problem. Smart contract developers should be aware that transient storage is not discarded when a call returns or reverts, as is memory, and should prefer memory for these use cases so as not to create unexpected behavior on reentrancy in the same transaction. The proposal also notes that most usages of in-memory mappings can be better implemented with key-sorted lists of entries, and in-memory mappings are rarely required in smart contracts.
