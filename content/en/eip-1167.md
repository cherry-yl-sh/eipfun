The ERC-1167: Minimal Proxy Contract is a standard for cloning contract functionality in a simple and cost-effective way. It specifies a minimal bytecode implementation that delegates all calls to a fixed address, allowing users and third-party tools to easily discover and depend on the behavior of the code at the destination contract. This implementation forwards all calls and gas to the implementation contract and relays the return value back to the caller. The standard clone contract bytecode is provided, with the bytes at indices 10-29 replaced with the 20 byte address of the master functionality contract. The goals of this effort have been to support inexpensive deployment and clone initialization in creation transactions, as well as to maintain a private reputation of contracts and keep track of which tokens and gas prices are used for deploying transactions. A reference implementation of the standard clone contract can be found on the optionality/clone-factory GitHub repository.
