EIP-2387 proposes the Muir Glacier hardfork in Ethereum to address the impending Ice Age, which artificially adds to the difficulty of the network and causes increased block times. The hardfork will push back the Ice Age and give time to update it to no longer have design problems. The hardfork will not include any changes to issuance, and the block reward will remain at 2 Eth per block. The hardfork will be activated at block >= 9,200,000 on the Ethereum mainnet and block >= 7,117,117 on the Ropsten testnet.
