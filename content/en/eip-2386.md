ERC-2386 proposes a JSON format for the storage and retrieval of Ethereum 2 hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet definitions. Hierarchical deterministic wallets create keys from a seed and a path, and the seed needs to be accessible to create new keys while also being protected to the same extent as private keys to prevent it from becoming an easy attack vector. The path, or at least the variable part of it, needs to be stored to ensure that keys are not duplicated. The proposal adds the concept of walletstores, which define wallets and how keys in said wallets are created. Standardizing this information and how it is stored allows it to be portable between different wallet providers with minimal effort. The proposal specifies the elements of a hierarchical deterministic walletstore, including a UUID, name, version, type, crypto, next account, and JSON schema. The UUID is a randomly-generated type 4 UUID used to uniquely identify wallets, and the name is a UTF-8 string intended to serve as the user-friendly accessor. The proposal also includes security considerations, such as the fact that the seed stored in the crypto section of the wallet can be used to generate any key along the derived path, reducing the security of all keys generated by HD wallets to the security of the passphrase and strength of the encryption used to protect the seed. Overall, the proposal aims to promote interoperability between wallets and similar software by standardizing the storage and retrieval of Ethereum 2 hierarchical deterministic wallet definitions.
