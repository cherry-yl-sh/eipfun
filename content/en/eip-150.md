## Summary

The EIP-150 proposal introduces changes to gas costs for IO-heavy operations in order to preserve the de-facto transactions-per-second processing capability of the system for average contracts. It also introduces the EIP 90 gas mechanic and EIP 114 to increase contract programming safety and eliminate call stack depth attacks as a class of attack that contract developers have to worry about. The proposal recommends a gas limit increase to achieve these goals.
