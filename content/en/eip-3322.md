EIP-3322, titled "Account gas storage opcodes," proposes a mechanism that allows contract accounts to store gas that can be transferred to the refund counter. This is aimed at providing a more efficient way for contracts to manage gas, reducing the need for unnecessary state growth.

The EIP introduces three new opcodes: SELFGAS, USEGAS, and STOREGAS. SELFGAS pushes the current account's gas refund counter onto the stack. USEGAS pops an amount from the stack, transferring the minimum of this amount and the current account's gas refund counter to the execution context's refund counter. STOREGAS pops an amount from the stack, increases the current account's gas refund counter by this amount, and costs 5000 plus the popped amount in gas.

The rationale behind this EIP is to provide a superior gas storage mechanism that requires less storage and computation. By reusing the execution context's refund counter, the EIP also leverages its 50% DoS protection, limiting its block elasticity contribution to 2x.

The EIP also discusses the gas costs, the opcode numbers chosen, and provides test cases. It anticipates no compatibility issues as the gas is added to the refund counter. The EIP also considers DoS, which is already limited by the 50% refund limit.
