The ERC-1328 proposal defines a URI format for connecting applications and wallets. This URI can be shown as a QR code or a link and includes parameters that depend on the version of the WalletConnect protocol being used. The proposal moves away from the JSON format used in the alpha version of the protocol to a URI format, which allows for more efficient parsing of the intent of the QR code and leverages the Android Intent system. The proposal also includes a versioning system to allow for backwards compatibility when new versions are introduced. The URI should not include any sensitive data that could compromise communication or allow control of the user's private keys. The proposal aims to keep backward compatibility with existing Ethereum URIs and not break existing things. Overall, the ERC-1328 proposal provides a standardized way for applications and wallets to connect and communicate securely.
