The ERC-1900 proposal suggests the creation of a decentralized Type System for Ethereum, called dType, to introduce data definition consistency and ensure a smooth flow of on-chain information. The proposal focuses on defining an on-chain Type Registry and a common interface for creating types based on structs. The Type Registry will allow for better analysis of blockchain data and creation of smart contract development tools for easily using existing types in a new smart contract. The proposal also suggests the creation of a decentralized Type System with Data Storage (ERC-2158) and dType Functions Extension, which will effectively create the base for a general functional programming system on Ethereum. The proposal aims to have a good decentralized medium for integrating all Ethereum data and relationships between the different types of data, as well as a way to address the behavior related to each data type. The proposal suggests that functional programming becomes easier, and Solidity development tools could be transparently extended to include the created types. At a later point, the EVM itself can have precompiled support for these types.
