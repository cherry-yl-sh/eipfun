## Summary

The ERC-6047 proposal aims to extend the ERC-721 standard by mandating the emission of the Transfer event during contract creation. Currently, ERC-721 requires the Transfer event to be emitted whenever a transfer, mint, or burn occurs, except during contract creation. This exception allows contracts to mint NFTs without emitting the event, making it difficult for indexers and off-chain applications to track token creation. The proposal removes this exception and mandates the emission of the Transfer event during contract creation, allowing for reliable tracking and indexing of NFTs. The proposal is backward compatible with existing indexers as it uses the existing Transfer event instead of creating a new event. Compliant contracts must implement ERC-721 and emit the Transfer event whenever a token is transferred, minted, or burned, including during contract creation. The proposal does not introduce any new security concerns and the copyright and related rights are waived via CC0.
