The ERC-902 proposal is a standard for validating token ownership and transfer on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides a registry contract method for authorizing token transfers, covering both the initial issuance of tokens to users, transferring tokens between users, and token spends. The motivation behind this proposal is the tokenization of assets, particularly financial instruments such as securities and security tokens, which have legal constraints on what can be traded and who can hold such tokens. This includes KYC and AML validation, time-based spend limits, total volume of transactions, and more. nnThe ERC-902 proposal aims to provide a way for regulators and third-party compliance agencies to link off-chain compliance information such as identity and residency to an on-chain service. It also allows for the sharing of on-chain resources, rules, and lists, rather than each token maintaining its own whitelist or other mechanism. Additionally, it enables the aggregation of data and rules spread across multiple validators, or the application of complex behaviors such as switching logic, gates, and state machines to apply distributed data to an application. nnThe proposal includes two main interfaces: TokenValidator and ValidatedToken. TokenValidator is an interface that provides a function for checking the validity of a token transfer, while ValidatedToken is an interface that provides a function for authorizing a token transfer. The proposal also includes methods for checking the validity of a token transfer based on the token, sender, and receiver addresses, as well as the amount being transferred. nnOverall, the ERC-902 proposal aims to provide a standardized way for validating token ownership and transfer on the Ethereum blockchain, particularly for financial instruments such as securities and security tokens. It enables compliance with legal regulations and allows for the sharing of on-chain resources and rules, making it easier to manage and trade tokens.
