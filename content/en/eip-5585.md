The ERC-5585 proposal suggests a standard method for artists to designate original and limited-edition prints with signatures on the Ethereum blockchain using ERC-721 compliant contracts. This helps create a more tangible link between NFTs, digital art, owners, and artists. The proposal also includes a user record struct to store authorized user rights and allows for seamless integration with third-party applications. The standard is backwards compatible with ERC-721 and includes security considerations for authorization fees. If a buyer uses ERC-20 tokens to purchase an NFT, they must first call the approve function of the ERC-20 token to grant the NFT contract access to a certain amount of tokens.
