## Summary

ERC-5409 is an extension of the EIP-1155 standard that proposes an additional function, ownerOf, which allows EIP-1155 tokens to support Non-Fungibility (unique owners). This enables the ability for the owner to associate data with the token and benefits from EIP-721's core functionality without implementing the (less efficient) EIP-721 specification in the same contract.
