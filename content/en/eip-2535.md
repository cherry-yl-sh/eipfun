The ERC-2535 proposal standardizes diamonds, which are modular smart contract systems that can be upgraded/extended after deployment, and have virtually no size limit. A diamond is a contract with external functions that are supplied by contracts called facets. Facets are separate, independent contracts that can share internal functions, libraries, and state variables. There are a number of different reasons to use diamonds, including having a single address for unlimited contract functionality, exceeding the 24KB maximum contract size, and providing a way to organize contract code and data. The proposal includes specifications for implementing diamonds, including terms, a note on implementing interfaces, fallback function, storage, solidity libraries as facets, adding/replacing/removing functions, inspecting facets & functions, and implementation points. The proposal also includes rationale for using function selectors, gas considerations, versions of functions, default function, loupe functions & diamondCut event, sharing functions between facets, and how facets can be reusable and composable. Backwards compatibility and security considerations are also addressed in the proposal.
