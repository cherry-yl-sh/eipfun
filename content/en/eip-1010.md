EIP-1010 proposes to improve the uniformity of ether distribution between two wallet addresses, 0xAb5801a7D398351b8bE11C439e05C5B3259aeC9B and 0x15E55EF43efA8348dDaeAa455F16C43B64917e3c, which currently have a significant non-uniformity in balance. The former address has over 365,000 ether more than the latter, and this difference must be addressed to protect the Ethereum economy from centralized control. The proposal suggests transferring 100,000 ether from the former address to the latter to achieve a more equitable distribution. This proposal is in line with the core Ethereum philosophy of decentralization.
