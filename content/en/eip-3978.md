## Summary

EIP-3978, titled "Gas refunds on reverts," proposes that for reverted state modification operations, the access cost should be kept, but the modification cost should be refunded. The motivation behind this proposal is that reverting a transaction, or any of its sub-calls, drops any state modifications that happened inside. However, users are currently charged for the dropped modifications as if they persisted.

The proposal specifies that for each call frame, a revert_gas_refund should be tracked, initially set to 0. The set of operations that modify revert_gas_refund include SSTORE, LOG0-LOG4, CALL, CREATE, CREATE2, and SELFDESTRUCT. These operations increase revert_gas_refund as follows: call.revert_gas_refund += operation.gas - WARM_STORAGE_READ_COST. In case of a revert, this value is used instead of just erasing gas_refund.

The rationale behind this proposal is that gas should reflect the cost of use. The revert cost reflects the cost of access during execution, but not the cost of modification. The document mentions that there are no known backward compatibility issues associated with this proposal. The test cases, reference implementation, and security considerations are yet to be determined.
