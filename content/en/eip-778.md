EIP-778 is an Ethereum Improvement Proposal that defines Ethereum Node Records (ENR), an open format for peer-to-peer connectivity information. ENR is a flexible format for relaying connectivity-related information, including transport protocols and public key material associated with them. It also provides authoritative updates of connectivity information and improves cryptographic agility and handling of protocol upgrades. ENR can be relayed through a future version of the node discovery protocol or other mechanisms such as DNS, ENS, or a devp2p subprotocol. The components of an ENR include a cryptographic signature of record contents, a sequence number, and arbitrary key/value pairs. The identity scheme is responsible for deriving a node's address in the DHT, and the key/value pairs must be sorted by key and must be unique. ENR is limited in size because records are relayed frequently and may be included in size-constrained protocols such as DNS.
