The EIP-1193 is a proposal for a standardized JavaScript API for Ethereum providers, which are key management software or "wallets" that expose their API via a JavaScript object in web pages. The goal of this proposal is to promote wallet interoperability by formalizing a common Ethereum Provider API that is minimal, event-driven, and agnostic of transport and RPC protocols. The API is designed to be easily extended by defining new RPC methods and message event types. nnThe proposal defines the connectivity, API, supported RPC methods, and events of the Ethereum Provider JavaScript API. It also includes sections on rationale, backwards compatibility, implementations, security considerations, and handling adversarial behavior. The proposal is intended to provide consistency across clients and applications in the Ethereum web application ecosystem. nnHistorically, Provider implementations have exhibited conflicting interfaces and behaviors between wallets, and this proposal aims to address this issue by providing a standardized API. The API is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing for future updates and improvements. nnIn summary, the EIP-1193 proposes a standardized JavaScript API for Ethereum providers to promote wallet interoperability and consistency across clients and applications in the Ethereum web application ecosystem.
