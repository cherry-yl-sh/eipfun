## Summary

EIP-6 proposes to change the name of the SUICIDE opcode in Ethereum programming languages to SELFDESTRUCT. The motivation behind this proposal is to avoid triggering negative emotions in those who suffer from depression or have lost someone to suicide. The proposal suggests adding SELFDESTRUCT as an alias of SUICIDE opcode rather than replacing it.
