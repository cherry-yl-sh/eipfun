ERC-3005 proposes a new function called processMetaBatch() that extends any fungible token standard, and enables batched meta transactions coming from many senders in one on-chain transaction. This allows for gasless transactions and reduces the relayer's gas cost due to batching. The proposal includes specifications for meta transaction data, validation rules, implementation, rationale, backwards compatibility, test cases, and security considerations.
