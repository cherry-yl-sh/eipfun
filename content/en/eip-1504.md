ERC-1504 is a proposal for a standard interface/guideline that makes Ethereum smart contracts upgradable. The motivation behind this proposal is to address the security issues that smart contracts have faced in the past, which have resulted in significant financial losses and hard forks of the Ethereum blockchain. The proposal provides basic functionalities to upgrade the operations of the contract without data migration, and it also includes a voting mechanism to ensure decentralization and community interests. The upgradable contract allows developers to deploy a new version of a smart contract after the previous deployment while retaining the data.
