EIP-4200, titled "EOF - Static relative jumps," proposes the introduction of three new EVM jump instructions (RJUMP, RJUMPI, and RJUMPV) which encode destinations as signed immediate values. These can be useful in the majority of use cases and offer a cost reduction. The motivation behind this proposal is that a recurring discussion topic is that EVM only has a mechanism for dynamic jumps, which makes the analysis of code more complicated and partially resulted in the need to have the JUMPDEST marker.

The proposal specifies that for each of these instructions, if the code is legacy bytecode, all of these instructions result in an exceptional halt. If the code is valid EOF1, RJUMP sets the PC to PC_post_instruction + relative_offset, RJUMPI pops a value (condition) from the stack, and sets the PC to PC_post_instruction + ((condition == 0) ? 0 : relative_offset), and RJUMPV sets the PC to PC_post_instruction + ((case > max_index) ? 0 : relative_offset[case]).

The rationale behind this proposal is that relative addressing supports code which is relocatable and allows a code snippet to be injected. The document mentions that there are no known backward compatibility issues associated with this proposal. The test cases, reference implementation, and security considerations are yet to be determined.
