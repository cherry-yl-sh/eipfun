The ERC-6997 proposal is an extension of ERC-721 that adds a new validation step for transfer and approve calls to prevent wallet draining and NFT theft. This validation step would require a validator address to approve transactions, which would make it more difficult for thieves to steal NFTs. The proposal also includes specifications for implementing this validation functionality and emphasizes the importance of security in protecting against unauthorized validation. Additionally, the proposal acknowledges the evolving use cases for NFTs, particularly in the realm of digital art, and suggests creating a concise standard for art to make it easier for artists to maintain a connection with the Ethereum blockchain and their fans. This standard would allow for the designation of original NFTs and printed editions with signatures in a trustless manner, creating a link between the NFT, digital art, owner, and artist. ERC-721 compliant contracts may implement this ERC for editions to provide a standard method for designating the original and limited-edition prints with signatures from the artist.
