## Summary

The EIP-2537 proposal is a standard for implementing BLS12-381 curve operations in Ethereum. It defines a set of precompiled contracts that can be used to perform these operations efficiently on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. The proposal includes functions for point addition, point multiplication, and pairing operations on the BLS12-381 curve. These operations are used in various cryptographic protocols, such as signature schemes and zero-knowledge proofs. The proposal also includes gas cost estimates for each operation, which are designed to ensure that they are economically feasible to use on the Ethereum network. Overall, the EIP-2537 proposal is an important step towards improving the security and efficiency of cryptographic operations on the Ethereum network.
