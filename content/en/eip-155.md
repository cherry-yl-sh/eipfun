## Summary

EIP-155 is a proposal for simple replay attack protection in Ethereum. It introduces a new parameter called CHAIN_ID, which is a unique identifier for each Ethereum network. This parameter is included in the transaction data and helps prevent replay attacks on different networks. The proposal also includes a list of Chain IDs for different Ethereum networks.
