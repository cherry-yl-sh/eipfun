The ERC-1948 proposal suggests extending non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with the ability to store dynamic data that can change during the token's lifetime. This is useful for NFT use-cases such as cryptokitties that can change color, intellectual property tokens that encode rights holders, and tokens that store data to transport them across chains. The existing metadata standard does not allow for dynamic data to be modified after minting, so this proposal aims to standardize tokens with dynamic data. nnThe proposal adds a 32-byte data field to NFTs and includes read and write functions to access and update the data, respectively. The write function can only be called by the owner of the token. An event is emitted every time the data updates, including the previous and new values. nnThe motivation behind this proposal is to enable interactions with bridges for side-chains like xDAI or Plasma chains and to enable protocols that build on data tokens like distributed breeding. nnIn addition to the ERC-1948 proposal, there is also a mention of a semi-fungible token that combines the quantitative features of ERC-20 with the qualitative attributes of ERC-721. This type of token would be backwards-compatible with ERC-721 and could lead to faster adoption.
