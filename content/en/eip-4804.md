The proposal of ERC-4804 is to provide a standard for translating Web3 URLs to EVM call messages in Ethereum. This aims to improve the communication between Web2 users and on-chain Web3 content by allowing users to directly access the content of Web3 without relying on Web2 proxies. The standard defines the format of a Web3 URL and specifies how it should be translated to an EVM call message. The standard only defines read-only semantics and may be extended in the future to include state modifying functions.
