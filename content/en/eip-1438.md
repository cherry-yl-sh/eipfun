## Summary

ERC-1438 proposes the creation of dApp components that can be reused in other services, instead of developing centralized services that use their own dApp-generated information. The proposal includes a universal wallet that can use ERC20 tokens universally, and a component dApp that allows users to create and save their avatar and social badge system, and use it immediately in other services. All of the dApps suggested in this document are based on decentralized development and use that anyone can create and participate in. The avatar store is created after ERC20 currency is set, and users can customize asset category and viewer script. The avatar's information and assets are stored in the event log part of the blockchain. The universal wallet includes an ERC20 interface and a fixed ERC20 contract for receive approval and execute function in one call. The proposal aims to improve the blockchain ecosystem by promoting synergy with other dApps and resources, enhancing the interface for ERC20 tokens, and making it easy and decentralized for everyone to add to their services without censorship.
