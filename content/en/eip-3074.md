EIP-3074 introduces two EVM instructions, AUTH and AUTHCALL, which allow externally owned accounts to delegate control to a contract. This gives developers a flexible framework for developing novel transaction schemes for EOAs and allows any EOA to act like a smart contract wallet without deploying a contract. The AUTHCALL instruction sets CALLER and implements the minimal functionality to enable sender abstraction for sponsored transactions. The proposal eliminates all signed fields except for invoker and commit, which are used for replay protection in the invoker contract.
