ERC-6492 proposes a standard way for any contract or off-chain actor to verify whether a signature on behalf of a given counterfactual contract (that is not deployed yet) is valid. This is important because contracts can sign verifiable messages via ERC-1271, but if the contract is not deployed yet, ERC-1271 verification is impossible. With the rising popularity of account abstraction, contract wallets often defer contract deployment until the first user transaction, which limits their ability to sign messages before their de-facto deployment. Furthermore, not being able to sign messages from counterfactual contracts has always been a limitation of ERC-1271. The proposal extends ERC-1271 to allow for signature validation for predeploy contracts. The specification includes a Last Call review window before moving to Final, and each EIP should have a Preamble, Abstract, and Motivation (optional) section.
