ERC-6170 proposes a common interface for cross-chain arbitrary message bridges (AMBs) to send and receive a cross-chain message (state). Currently, there is a lack of standardization in cross-chain arbitrary message bridges, resulting in complex competing implementations. Adding a common standardized interface to the arbitrary message bridges provides benefits such as ease of development, improved scalability, improved security, and improved robustness. The proposal specifies that every compliant cross-chain arbitrary message bridge must implement the interface outlined in the proposal. The proposal uses keywords such as "MUST," "MUST NOT," "REQUIRED," "SHALL," "SHALL NOT," "SHOULD," "SHOULD NOT," "RECOMMENDED," "MAY," and "OPTIONAL" to define the requirements.
