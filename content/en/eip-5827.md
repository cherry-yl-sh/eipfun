The ERC-5827 proposal adds a renewable allowance mechanism to ERC-20 allowances, allowing for automatic renewals on allowance approvals. This is useful for recurring payments such as subscriptions or salaries. The recoveryRate defines the amount of token per second that the allowance regains towards the initial maximum approval amount. This eliminates the need for users to grant large or unlimited allowances, which can be a security risk. The proposal includes a specification and additional interfaces, as well as a rationale for the extension. The proposal is currently in Last Call status before moving to Final.
