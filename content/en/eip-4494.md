The ERC-4494 is a proposal to extend the "Permit" approval flow outlined in ERC-2612 to ERC-721 NFTs. This would allow for a signed message to be used to create an approval for an NFT, rather than requiring two separate transactions for approval and transfer. The proposal borrows heavily from ERC-2612, but requires a separate EIP due to the differences in structure between ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens. The motivation behind this proposal is to improve the user experience for NFT transactions and to provide a more efficient and secure approval process. Implementors of the EIP721Consumable standard are advised to consider the permissions they give to consumers and restrict them to owners only, even if they implement the standard correctly and do not allow transfer or burning of NFTs.
