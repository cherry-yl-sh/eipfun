EIP-3651, titled "Warm COINBASE," proposes that the COINBASE address should be warm at the start of transaction execution, aligning with the actual cost of reading that account. This proposal is motivated by the increasing popularity of direct COINBASE payments, which allow conditional payments and provide benefits such as implicit cancellation of transactions that would revert. However, accessing COINBASE is overpriced as the address is initially cold under the access list framework introduced in EIP-2929. This gas cost mismatch can incentivize alternative payments besides ETH, such as ERC-20, but ETH should be the primary means of paying for transactions on Ethereum.

The proposal specifies that at the start of transaction execution, accessed_addresses should be initialized to also include the address returned by COINBASE (0x41). The rationale is that the addresses currently initialized warm are the addresses that should already be loaded at the start of transaction validation. The COINBASE address should also always be loaded because it receives the block reward and the transaction fees.

The document mentions that there are no known backward compatibility issues or security considerations associated with this proposal.
