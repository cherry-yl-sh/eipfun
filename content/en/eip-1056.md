ERC-1056 is a standard for creating and managing lightweight blockchain identities on the Ethereum network. The goal is to make identity creation free and easy, while also allowing for unlimited delegates and attributes associated with each identity. The standard is fully DID compliant and can be used both on-chain and off-chain. The EthereumDIDRegistry contract is specified in the ERC and can be deployed once for common use. The identifier for each identity is an Ethereum address, and delegates can be assigned for specific functions on behalf of the identity. Attributes are pieces of data associated with the identity. The motivation for creating this ERC was to address the high cost of identity creation and the need for offline identity creation in scenarios such as refugee situations. The ERC is backward compatible and can be implemented and deployed by anyone.
