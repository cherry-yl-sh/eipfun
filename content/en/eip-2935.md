## Summary

EIP-2935 proposes to save historical block hashes in the Ethereum state, allowing smart contracts to access the block hash of any block in the past 256 blocks. This is achieved through the addition of a new opcode, BLOCKHASH256, which extends the range of the existing BLOCKHASH opcode. The proposal simplifies the structure of the Ethereum state by removing the need for a tree-like structure with multiple layers and writing the EIP in EVM code. The proposal adds approximately 2.5 million storage slots per year, which may bloat the state somewhat, but is not expected to have a significant impact relative to the hundreds of millions of existing state objects. The proposal is not intended to be permanent and will likely be repurposed when eth1 is merged into eth2. The proposal is backward compatible and does not require any changes for users or miners, except for a scheduled network upgrade.
