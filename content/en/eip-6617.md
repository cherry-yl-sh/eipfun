ERC-6617 proposes a standard for building a bit-based permission and role system for Ethereum. Each permission is represented by a single bit, allowing up to 256 permissions and 2^256 roles to be defined using an uint256. The importance of each permission can be specified based on the order of the bits. This system offers greater gas-efficiency and flexibility compared to current permission and access control methods. Bitwise operations are cheap and fast, making them a more efficient option. The specification requires that permissions be defined as a power of two, unique, and that 0 be used for none permission. The EIP also provides test cases and a reference implementation. Overall, ERC-6617 aims to improve permission and access control on the Ethereum network.
