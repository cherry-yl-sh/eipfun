ERC-6093 is an Ethereum Improvement Proposal that defines a standard set of custom errors for commonly-used tokens, including ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155 tokens. The proposal aims to provide a structured and expected way for clients to implement decoding for transaction errors, which historically relied on revert reason strings. The proposal lists custom errors for common token implementations, such as ERC721InvalidOwner and ERC721NonexistentToken, and includes a parameter glossary and error additions. The proposal also discusses the rationale behind the standardization of errors, including the benefits of reducing deployment costs and providing more consistent error messages across applications and testing environments. The proposal is still in draft form as of December 2022, and includes a reference implementation in Solidity and considerations for backwards compatibility and security.
