## Summary

The EIP-2970 proposal is related to the Ethereum blockchain and suggests the addition of a new opcode called IS_STATIC. This opcode would allow smart contract developers to check whether their contract is being called in a static or non-static context. In a static context, the contract is being called for view or pure functions, which do not modify the state of the blockchain. In a non-static context, the contract is being called for functions that modify the state of the blockchain. The IS_STATIC opcode would help developers optimize their code by allowing them to skip unnecessary checks and operations when their contract is being called in a static context. This proposal is still in draft form and has not yet been implemented.
