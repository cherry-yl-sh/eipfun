## Summary

EIP-4762 proposes changes to the gas cost of state access operations in Ethereum to incentivize statelessness and reduce the cost of stateful contracts. The proposal introduces a new opcode, SLOADSTATE, which allows contracts to access state without incurring the high gas costs associated with accessing storage. Instead, the gas cost for SLOADSTATE is fixed at 100 gas per operation, regardless of the size of the accessed data. This is intended to encourage developers to design stateless contracts that rely on inputs and outputs rather than maintaining state on-chain. The proposal also includes changes to the gas cost of other state access operations, such as SSTORE and BALANCE, to further incentivize statelessness. The changes are expected to reduce the cost of stateful contracts and improve the scalability of the Ethereum network. However, there are potential risks associated with the changes, such as contract breakage, which the proposal addresses through mitigations such as the accessed_addresses and accessed_storage_keys map and the addition of a POKE precompile or EIP-2930. Overall, EIP-4762 aims to balance the benefits of statelessness with the need to maintain backward compatibility and minimize disruption to the Ethereum ecosystem.
