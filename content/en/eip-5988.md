The EIP-5988 proposal suggests adding a precompiled contract to Ethereum that implements the hash function used in the Poseidon cryptographic hashing algorithm. This is intended to allow interoperability between the EVM and ZK/Validity rollups, as well as introducing more flexible cryptographic hash primitives to the EVM. The Poseidon hash function is particularly well-suited for building efficient ZK/Validity rollups on Ethereum, and is compatible with all major proof systems. The precompile will support arbitrary parameters, allowing ZK rollups to choose the parameters they want to use. The proposal includes specifications for the precompile, as well as test cases and security considerations.
