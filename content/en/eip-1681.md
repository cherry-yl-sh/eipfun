EIP-1681 proposes adding a "temporal" replay protection to Ethereum transactions by including a valid-until timestamp. This would prevent pre-signed transactions stored on paper backups from becoming invalid after a certain block. The motivation for this proposal includes the need for replay protection in the event of dust-account clearing and the desire to prioritize transactions during ICOs. The roll-out would occur in two phases, with the addition of the valid-until field at block X (hardfork) and the invalidation of pre-signed transactions at block Y (softfork). The main difference between this proposal and a similar one (EIP-599) is that EIP-1681 uses clock-time/walltime instead of block numbers.
