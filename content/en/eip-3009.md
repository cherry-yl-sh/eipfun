ERC-3009 is a proposal for a contract interface that enables transferring of fungible assets via a signed authorization. It includes a set of functions to enable meta-transactions and atomic interactions with ERC-20 token contracts via signatures conforming to the EIP-712 typed message signing specification. This enables users to delegate gas payment to someone else, pay for gas in the token itself, perform one or more token transfers and other operations in a single atomic transaction, transfer ERC-20 tokens to another address, batch multiple transactions with minimal overhead, and create and perform multiple transactions without worrying about nonce-reuse or improper ordering by the miner. The proposal uses unique random nonces instead of sequential nonces and relies on the ERC-20 transfer pattern instead of the approve/transferFrom pattern.
