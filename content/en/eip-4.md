EIP-4 is a document that outlines the different classifications that an EIP can have. These classifications include Standards Track, Informational, Meta, and Process. Standards Track EIPs are those that propose changes to the Ethereum protocol and must go through a rigorous review process before being accepted as a final standard. Informational EIPs provide information about Ethereum but do not propose any changes to the protocol. Meta EIPs are those that propose changes to the EIP process itself. Process EIPs are those that propose changes to the way that Ethereum is developed and maintained. EIP-4 also outlines the different statuses that an EIP can have, including Draft, Last Call, Final, Withdrawn, and Living. Draft EIPs are those that are still being developed and are not yet ready for review. Last Call EIPs are those that are in the final review window before being moved to Final status. Final EIPs are those that represent the final standard and should only be updated to correct errors or add clarifications. Withdrawn EIPs are those that have been withdrawn by the author and can no longer be resurrected using the same EIP number. Living EIPs are those that are designed to be continually updated and not reach a state of finality. Overall, EIP-4 provides a clear framework for classifying and managing EIPs within the Ethereum community.
