The ERC-2876 proposal defines a contract interface and a new address format for managing deposits in a way that allows for accepting ETH payments from multiple depositors without the need for managing multiple keys or requiring use of a hot wallet. The proposal aims to lower the cost of deploying and managing a system that accepts deposits from many users, and by standardizing the methodology for this, services across the world can easily use this interface to send value to and from each other without the need to create multiple accounts. The proposal also has the benefit of allowing for all deposits to be forwarded to a cold wallet directly without any manual operations to gather deposits from multiple external accounts. Adoption of ERC-2876 by all exchanges, merchants, and all wallet applications/libraries will likely decrease total network gas usage by these systems. The proposal defines key terms and specifications, including the contract interface, deposit address format, and definitions for key words used in the document.
