EIP-1679 is a meta-EIP that specifies the changes included in the Ethereum hard fork named Istanbul. It was created by Alex Beregszaszi and Afri Schoedon in January 2019. The purpose of the meta-EIP is to provide visibility and traceability of the scope of changes included in the hard fork, as well as to provide a simple name and/or number for referring to the proposed fork. The Istanbul hard fork was activated on the Ethereum mainnet at block number 9,069,000, and on various testnets at different block numbers. The meta-EIP includes a template for the Istanbul hard fork, as well as a list of the EIPs that were included in the hard fork. These EIPs include EIP-152, EIP-1108, EIP-1344, EIP-1884, EIP-2028, and EIP-2200. Each of these EIPs specifies a particular change or improvement to the Ethereum network, such as reducing gas costs for certain operations or adding a new opcode. The meta-EIP also specifies that the EIPs included in the hard fork should move from the Accepted state to the Final state once the hard fork has been activated. Overall, EIP-1679 provides a clear and organized way to coordinate and implement changes to the Ethereum network through a hard fork.
