ERC-6372 proposes the addition of a contract clock to the Ethereum blockchain. The contract clock would allow for the scheduling of contract executions at specific times or intervals, similar to a cron job in traditional computing. This would enable developers to create time-based smart contracts, such as recurring payments or time-based auctions, without the need for external services or manual intervention. The proposal includes details on the implementation of the contract clock, including the use of a timestamp oracle and the ability to cancel scheduled executions. The proposal is still in draft form as of January 2023.
