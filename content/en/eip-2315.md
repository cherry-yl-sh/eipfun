The EIP-2315 proposal suggests adding simple subroutines to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to make it easier to statically analyze and optimize EVM code. Currently, the EVM only supports dynamic jumps, which make it difficult to analyze and optimize code. The proposal suggests adding subroutines and static jumps to the EVM to make it easier to analyze and optimize code. This would allow for near-linear time validation and optimization of EVM contracts, which would improve the performance and security of the Ethereum network. The proposal also suggests using a versioning scheme to allow for the deployment of new bytecode alongside existing bytecode on the same blockchain.
