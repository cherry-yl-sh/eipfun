The ERC-3754 is a proposed standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that are ideal for representing abstract ownership, such as rights. This standard encourages layers of abstraction built on top of the NFT, making it easier to transfer ownership and allowing for tokenization of abstract concepts like NFT options, oracle membership, and virtual coupons. The standard aims to improve the conceptual clarity of NFTs and provide an on-chain subscription business model. The NFTs defined in this standard are distinct from those defined in the ERC-721 standard, as they exclude data fields and functions related to URI. The security of this standard is enhanced from ERC-721, as tokens are minted without having to provide URIs, avoiding errors in dealing with URIs. The reference implementation for this standard can be found on GitHub.
