ERC-3000 is a proposed standard for contracts to optimistically enact governance decisions made off-chain. It presents a basic on-chain spec for scheduling, executing, and challenging contract executions based on off-chain approval. The standard defines six entrypoint functions to contracts supporting the standard, but allows for any sort of resolver mechanism for the challenge/response games characteristic of optimistic contracts. The authors believe that it is very important that this standard leaves the other open to any resolver mechanism to be implemented and adopted. The standard allows for the resolver for challenges to be configured, and even have different resolvers for coexisting scheduled payloads. Choosing the right resolver requires making the right tradeoff between security, time to finality, implementation complexity, and external dependencies. The standard has been designed such that changing to another mechanism is possible, even allowing to hot-swap it in the same live instance. The authors currently believe resolving challenges using a subjective oracle is the right tradeoff, but the standard has been designed such that changing to another mechanism is possible, such as a deterministic resolver like Optimismâs OVM uses. ERC-3000 should be seen as a public good of top of which public infrastructure will be built, being way more important than any particular implementation or the interests of specific companies or projects.
