## Summary

ERC-6787 is a proposed set of interface specifications that define a decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol for trading assets using order books. It proposes a novel two-phase withdrawal scheme to ensure the asset security of both users and the exchange, addressing usersâ trust issues with the exchange. The two-phase forced withdrawal mechanism aims to protect usersâ financial security while ensuring the security of the exchangeâs assets. The standard defines interfaces for deposit, withdraw, and forced withdrawals.
