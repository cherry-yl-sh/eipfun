The EIP-100 proposal, authored by Vitalik Buterin, suggests a change in the difficulty adjustment formula used in the Ethereum blockchain. Currently, the formula takes into account the timestamp of the parent block and the difficulty of the parent block, among other factors, to determine the difficulty of the new block. However, this formula does not account for the presence of uncle blocks, which are blocks that are not included in the main blockchain but are still valid and can be used to calculate rewards.nnThe proposed change in the formula aims to target a constant average rate of blocks produced, including uncle blocks, to ensure a predictable issuance rate that cannot be manipulated by increasing the uncle rate. The new formula takes into account the timestamp of the parent block, the number of uncle blocks included, and a new adjustment factor that ensures the block time remains roughly the same.nnThe rationale behind this change is to prevent miners from manipulating the uncle rate to increase their rewards, which can lead to an unpredictable issuance rate and potentially harm the stability of the network. By targeting a constant average rate of blocks produced, the EIP-100 proposal aims to ensure a more stable and predictable issuance rate.nnOverall, the EIP-100 proposal is an important step towards improving the stability and predictability of the Ethereum blockchain, and it highlights the ongoing efforts to address potential flaws and vulnerabilities in the network.
