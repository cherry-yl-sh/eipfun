EIP-1890 proposes a mechanism for capturing a portion of block rewards for ecosystem funding in Ethereum. This is meant to provide a credible commitment to funding R&D teams fairly for their work on the platform, but the actual amount of rewards captured remains at zero. The proposal specifies two parameters, a beneficiary address and a per-block reward denominated in wei, both of which are set to zero. The proposal does not aim to change Ethereum governance and must go through the existing governance process before implementation. The proposal calls for the network to come together and fund its own development, rather than relying solely on the Ethereum Foundation. The best way to organize these funds is still being worked out.
