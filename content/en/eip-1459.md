The EIP-1459 proposal suggests a scheme for authenticated, updateable Ethereum node lists retrievable via DNS. This would replace hard-coded bootstrap node lists in Ethereum clients and allow for larger, regularly updated lists with many additional benefits. The node list is a list of node records of arbitrary length, which may refer to other lists using links. The entire list is signed using a secp256k1 private key, and the corresponding public key must be known to the client in order to verify the list. To refer to a DNS node list, clients use a URL with 'enrtree' scheme, which contains the DNS name on which the list can be found as well as the public key that signed the list. This proposal was created by Felix Lange and PÃ©ter SzilÃ¡gyi in 2018.
