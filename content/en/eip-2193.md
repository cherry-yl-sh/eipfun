ERC-2193 proposes a system for providing human-readable resource identifiers to on-chain content called dType Alias. This system is based on the type of data and the data content and supports any type of data. The motivation behind this proposal is to address the need for attaching human-readable identifiers to Ethereum accounts in a more intuitive and widely used approach, which is a root->leaf format. With the help of EIP-1900 and EIP-2157, general content addressability can be achieved. dType provides type information and a reference to the smart contract where the type instances are stored. Multiple aliases can be assigned to a single resource, and each separator can have a specific standard for displaying and processing data based on its semantic meaning. The proposal includes an in-work implementation, and it will be updated with an appropriate implementation when consensus is reached on the specifications.
