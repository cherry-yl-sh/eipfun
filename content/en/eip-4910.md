ERC-4910 is a proposal to extend the ERC-721 standard to include royalty bearing NFTs. It aims to define, process, and pay on-chain NFT royalties, including hierarchical royalty structures. The proposal builds upon the OpenZeppelin Smart Contract Toolbox architecture and includes royalty account management, royalty balance and payments management, simple trading capabilities, and capabilities to trace trading on exchanges. The motivation behind the proposal is to preclude central authorities from manipulating or circumventing payments to those who are legally entitled to them, and to provide a standardized way of signaling royalty information across all NFT marketplaces.
