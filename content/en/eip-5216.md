The ERC-5216 proposal is an extension for the EIP-1155 standard that defines standard functions for granular approval of EIP-1155 tokens by both id and amount. This is important because EIP-1155 is commonly used for creating multiple ids, each with multiple tokens, and many projects interface with these semi-fungible tokens, particularly NFT marketplaces. However, the current setApprovalForAll function in EIP-1155 approves ALL tokens with a specific id, which has obvious minimum required trust flaws. The ERC-5216 proposal combines ideas from EIP-20 and EIP-721 to create a trust mechanism where an owner can allow a third party, such as a marketplace, to approve a limited (instead of unlimited) number of tokens of one id. The proposal is currently in the process of being peer-reviewed and interested parties are encouraged to participate in the discussion.
