ERC-1616 is a standard that provides a basic interface for querying a registry for attribute metadata assigned to Ethereum accounts. Instead of relying directly on the reputation of a claims issuer to assess the veracity of a given claim, trust can be brought up to the level of a registry curator. This registry, which is called an "Attribute Registry," allows for reduced complexity in implementation since a party needing to verify an attribute can now work with a trusted claims aggregator instead of relying on individual claim providers. Claims are abstracted as standard "attributes" which represent metadata assigned to an account, with claims decoupled from the issuing party. Attributes are registered as a flat uint256 -> uint256 key-value pair on each account, with the important property that each attribute type has one canonical value per address. This property allows for composability of attribute registries and advanced attribute formation. There is a generic method for determining the set of attribute keys or IDs made available by the registry. The standard does not specify requirements or recommendations for how attributes and their values are managed, or what additional metadata may be associated with attributes. Potential advanced uses of attribute registries include encoding complex boolean expressions which combine multiple attributes into a single uint256 key, using values associated with an attribute to query additional on-chain or off-chain metadata, and resolving attribute values by calling into separate attribute registries or other contracts, delegating authority without changing the interface of the registry.
