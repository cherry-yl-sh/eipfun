EIP-2733, titled "Transaction Package," proposes a new transaction type that executes a package of one or more transactions, while passing status information to subsequent transactions. This aims to provide a flexible framework for relayers to "sponsor" many transactions at once, trustlessly, and facilitates bundling transactions for single users.

The EIP introduces a new EIP-2718 transaction type where id = 2. The structure includes chain_id, children, nonce, gas_price, v, r, and s. Each ChildTransaction transaction will generate a ChildReceipt after execution. Each of these receipts will be aggregated into a Receipt.

Subsequent ChildTransactions will be able to receive the result of the previous ChildTransaction via RETURNDATACOPY in the first frame of execution, before making any subcalls. Each element, except the last, will be 0-padded left to 32 bytes.

The intrinsic cost of the transaction package is defined, and the execution of transaction packages is outlined in a series of steps. The EIP also discusses the validity of a TransactionPackage, and conditions under which it can be deemed valid or invalid.
