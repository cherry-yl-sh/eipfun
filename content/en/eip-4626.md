The ERC-4626 proposal is a standard API for tokenized Vaults representing shares of a single underlying EIP-20 token. It provides basic functionality for depositing and withdrawing tokens and reading balances. The motivation behind this proposal is to create more consistent and robust implementation patterns for yield-bearing vaults and lower the integration effort for protocols. The proposal requires implementation of EIP-20 and its optional metadata extensions, and may implement EIP-2612 for improved UX.
