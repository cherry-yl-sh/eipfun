ERC-1271 proposes a standard way for contracts to verify whether a signature on behalf of a given contract is valid. Currently, only Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) can sign messages with their associated private keys, but contracts cannot. This proposal aims to provide a mechanism for contracts to indicate whether a given signature is valid or not on its behalf. This is important for applications that require signatures to be provided, such as decentralized exchanges with off-chain order books, where buy/sell orders are signed messages. EOAs sign orders, signaling their desire to buy/sell a given asset and giving explicit permissions to the exchange smart contracts to conclude a trade via a signature. However, regular signatures are not possible for contracts since they do not possess a private key. The proposal suggests implementing an isValidSignature(hash, signature) function on the signing contract, which can be called to validate a signature. The proposal includes specifications, rationale, backwards compatibility, reference implementation, security considerations, and copyright information.
