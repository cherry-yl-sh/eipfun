The EIP-5593 proposal aims to restrict the injection of Ethereum Provider APIs, which are used to interact with smart contracts, in order to improve security. The proposal suggests implementing a trust-minimized upgradeability proxy, which would allow for upgrades to smart contracts without compromising security. The proxy would have a time delay before an actual upgrade, to prevent abuse, and users would need to ensure that the proxy they interact with is trustworthy and represents an exact copy of the code. The proposal acknowledges that some complex systems may require upgrades and that decentralized governance can be used for upgrade management. However, the use of a trust-minimized proxy is seen as a critically important option for smart contract development today. The proposal also references other EIPs related to contract code size limits and multi-injected provider discovery.
