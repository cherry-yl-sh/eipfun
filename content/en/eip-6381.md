## Summary

The ERC-6381 proposal introduces a new utility for ERC-721 and ERC-1155 non-fungible tokens (NFTs) by allowing them to be reacted to using Unicode standardized emojis in a public non-gated repository smart contract. This introduces interactivity to owning an NFT and unlocks feedback-based NFT mechanics. The ability to track on-chain reactions to NFTs allows for trust and objective evaluation of a given token, and designing the tokens to evolve when certain emote thresholds are met incentivizes interaction with the token collection. Additionally, having the ability for users to emote to the tokens adds the possibility of potential buyers and sellers gauging the value of the token based on the impressions the token has collected. The proposal includes a specification for the ERC-6381 Emotable Extension for Non-Fungible Tokens, which is compatible with ERC-165. The proposal is currently in the process of being peer-reviewed and interested parties are encouraged to participate in the discussion.
