EIP-3338 proposes to limit account nonces to be between 0 and 2^52 in order to optimize state witnesses and facilitate minor optimizations in clients. This change should not have any visible effect as there are currently no accounts with nonces exceeding this limit. The proposal also introduces two new restrictions for transactions and the CREATE instruction. This change does not have any significant security considerations and is backward compatible.
