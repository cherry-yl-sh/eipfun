ERC-4906 proposes to add a MetadataUpdate event to the EIP-721 metadata update standard in Ethereum. This extension will make it easier for third-party platforms, such as NFT marketplaces, to timely update the metadata of many NFTs. The extension is optional for EIP-721 contracts and the MetadataUpdate event will emit when the metadata of a token or a range of tokens is changed.
