EIP-1470 proposes a classification scheme for security weaknesses in Ethereum smart contracts called Smart Contract Weakness Classification (SWC). The SWC is a software weakness classification scheme for developers, tool vendors, and security practitioners that is loosely aligned with the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) scheme while overlaying a wide range of weakness variants that are specific to smart contracts. The goals of the SWC scheme are to provide a straightforward way to classify weaknesses in smart contract systems, identify the weakness(es) that lead to a vulnerability in a smart contract system, define a common language for describing weaknesses in smart contract systemsâ€™ architecture, design, and code, and train and increase the performance of smart contract security analysis tools. The SWC does not aim to reinvent the wheel in regards to classification of security weaknesses but rather proposes to build on top of what has worked well in other parts of the software security community, specifically the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE). The SWC proposes to create smart contract specific variants while linking back to the larger spectrum of software errors and mistakes listed in the CWE that different platforms and technologies have in common. The SWC uses Relationships to link SWC smart contract weakness variants to existing Base or Class CWE types to provide context on how SWCs are linked to the wider group of software security weaknesses and to be able to generate useful visualizations and insights through issue data sets.
