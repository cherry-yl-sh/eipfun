ERC-6909 is a draft proposal for a minimal specification for managing multiple tokens by their id in a single contract in Ethereum. It aims to provide a simplified alternative to the ERC-1155 Multi-Token Standard by removing unnecessary features such as requiring recipient accounts with code to implement callbacks returning specific values and batch-calls in the specification. The proposal also removes the single operator permission scheme that grants unlimited allowance on every token ID in the contract. The specification is deliberately kept minimal to minimize the required external interface and improve runtime performance. The proposal does not include features such as batch calls, increase and decrease allowance methods, and other user experience improvements. The proposal also allows for opinionated batch transfer operations on different implementations. Overall, ERC-6909 aims to provide a more streamlined and efficient way to manage multiple tokens in a single contract in Ethereum.
