## Summary

EIP-1276 proposes to eliminate the difficulty bomb, which causes block times to increase, and reduce block rewards with the Constantinople fork. The client will calculate difficulty without considering the current block number, and block rewards will be adjusted to a base of 2 ETH, with uncle and nephew rewards adjusted accordingly. The motivation behind this proposal is to respond to the block time increase caused by the difficulty bomb, which was delayed last year but is expected to happen again before the implementation of the Casper protocol. The proposal introduces backwards incompatibilities in the difficulty calculation and reward structure, so it should be included in a scheduled hardfork at a certain block number, preferably the second Metropolis hard-fork, Constantinople. Test cases and implementation will be created once the specification is accepted by developers or implemented by clients.
