ERC-2917 is a new standard for on-chain calculation of staking rewards in decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. It calculates the reward a user can get at any time based on the product of effective collateral and time. The formula for the calculation of reward for a user changes whenever the productivity of a user changes (increase/decrease) or whenever a user withdraws. The motivation behind this standard is to address the drawbacks of existing reward distribution mechanisms in DeFi projects, which either have a long cycle for rewards distribution or involve off-chain computation, leading to a lack of transparency and fairness. ERC-2917 aims to provide a more decentralized and transparent approach to reward distribution in DeFi projects.
