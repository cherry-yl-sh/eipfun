ERC-1462 is a proposal for a base security token in Ethereum that provides compliance with securities regulations and legal enforceability. It defines a minimal set of additions to the default token standard, such as ERC-20, that allows for compliance with domestic and international legal requirements, including KYC and AML regulations. The proposal also includes the ability to lock tokens for an account and restrict them from transfer due to a legal dispute, as well as the ability to attach additional legal documentation to set up a dual-binding relationship between the token and off-chain legal entities. The scope of the standard is kept narrow to avoid restricting potential use-cases, and any additional functionality and limitations not defined in the standard may be enforced on a per-project basis. The motivation behind the proposal is to provide a simple and modular solution for creating a base security token for the widest possible scope of applications, so it can be used by other issuers to build upon. The proposal addresses concerns with other security token standards, such as ERC-1400 and ERC-1411, which contain many project-specific or market-specific details and dependencies. The proposal extends the ERC-20 token with additional checking functions and documentation functions, while maintaining backwards compatibility.
