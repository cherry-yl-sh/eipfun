The EIP-1872 proposal for Ethereum Network Upgrade Windows aims to provide regularity and predictability to the network upgrade/hard fork process. It defines a limited number of annual time windows for network upgrades to be launched, with four different weeks spaced evenly throughout the year. Regular network upgrades should announce their intention to launch in a particular window early in their process and choose a block number four to six weeks prior to that window. If a network upgrade is cancelled, it would be rescheduled for the next window. Priority upgrades outside the roadmap may be scheduled in the third week of any month, but such use is discouraged. Critical upgrades are scheduled as needed. The proposal also provides scheduling for three categories of network upgrades: Roadmap network upgrades that include deliberate protocol improvements, Priority network updates where there are technical reasons that necessitate a prompt protocol change but these reasons do not present a systemic risk to the protocol or the ecosystem, and Critical network upgrades to address issues that present a systemic risk to the protocol or the ecosystem. The proposal includes a list of specific dates for the Roadmap and Priority windows through next year, excluding Roadmap windows. The aim of this proposal is to allow service providers such as exchanges and node operators a predictable framework to schedule activities around and to regularize the delivery of network upgrades.
