## Summary

The proposal of EIP-4803 is to limit transaction gas to a maximum of 2^63-1 in Ethereum. It aims to mitigate the harm caused by potential quadratic-complexity DoS attacks that rely on calls by limiting the de-facto maximum call stack depth to ~340 (down from ~1024). Additionally, it recommends a gas limit increase to preserve the de-facto transactions-per-second processing capability of the system for average contracts.
