The ERC-2390 proposal outlines a standard for geographically split horizon DNS resolution in the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) system, called Geo-ENS. This allows for resource records specific to an end user's location to be returned, similar to traditional GeoDNS systems. The proposal includes a resolver interface for storing DNS resource records and a function for querying based on a geohash of less than 8 characters, which defines the query region. This has implications for data privacy, as users who run light clients or rely on nodes run by third parties may leak their location data. The proposal also notes that GeoENS can be used for more than just geographic split horizon DNS, including IPFS content hash storage. Overall, the proposal aims to give the ENS system geo-proximal awareness and expand its capabilities beyond traditional DNS-based solutions.
