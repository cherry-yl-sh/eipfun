The EIP-2780 proposal aims to reduce the intrinsic cost of a transaction from 21,000 to 7,000 gas on the Ethereum network in order to make sending transactions cheaper. The proposal is easily achievable and does not incur technical debt, but it should only be made after determining that it does not impose non-negligible externalities such as increasing uncle rate or the pace at which the state-size of Ethereum grows. The proposal is designed to be backward compatible and compatible with other approaches pursued in other EIPs. The creators of gas tokens have outlined the maximal potential savings when minting a large number of tokens, and the proposed change is expected to have a minimal effect on the savings multiplier in a more realistic scenario where 100 gas tokens are minted.
