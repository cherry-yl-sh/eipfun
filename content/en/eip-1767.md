EIP-1767 proposes a GraphQL schema for accessing data stored on an Ethereum node, which aims to provide a complete replacement to the read-only information exposed via the present JSON-RPC interface, while improving on usability, consistency, efficiency, and future-proofing. The current JSON-RPC interface for Ethereum nodes has a number of shortcomings, such as being informally and incompletely specified in areas, which has led to incompatibilities around issues such as representation of empty byte strings and having to make educated guesses about the data a user will request, which often leads to unnecessary work. The proposed GraphQL schema facilitates more efficient API implementations, while also increasing flexibility. Compatible nodes must provide a GraphQL endpoint available over HTTP, which should be offered on port 8547 by default. The path to the GraphQL endpoint should be â/graphqlâ. Compatible nodes may offer a GraphiQL interactive query explorer on the root path (â/â). The GraphQL schema for this service is defined as a core set of types and fields that reflects the trend of Ethereum nodes moving away from providing read-write functionality such as transaction and message signing, and from other services such as code compilation, in favor of a more âunix-likeâ approach where each task is performed by a dedicated process. Two areas of the current API interface have been omitted for simplicity in this initial standard, with the intention that they will be defined in a later EIP.
