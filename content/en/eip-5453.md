ERC-5453 is a draft proposal for a general protocol that allows for approving function calls in the same transaction, relying on EIP-5750. The motivation behind this proposal is to support permit (approval) alongside a function call, a second approval from another user, pay-for-by another user, multi-sig, persons acting in concert by endorsements, accumulated voting, and off-line signatures. The proposal specifies interfaces and structures that are required for the protocol to function properly, including ValidityBound, SingleEndorsementData, and GeneralExtensionDataStruct. The proposal also addresses security considerations such as replay attacks and phishing. However, it should be noted that this proposal is still in draft form and has not been finalized or implemented yet.
