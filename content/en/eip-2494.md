The ERC-2494 proposal is a specification for the Baby Jubjub Elliptic Curve, which is designed to work inside zk-SNARK circuits in Ethereum. The proposal describes the generation process of the curve, including the choice of prime number and the selection of generator and base points. The curve is designed to be safe against well-known attacks and has passed SafeCurves security tests. The proposal also discusses the different forms of the curve and the birational maps that make it possible to map points from one form to another. Overall, the ERC-2494 proposal provides a standardized way to use the Baby Jubjub curve in cryptographic primitives that make use of elliptic curves, such as the Pedersen Hash or the Edwards Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA).
