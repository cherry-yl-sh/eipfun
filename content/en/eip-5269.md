The ERC-5269 proposal is an interface for better identification and detection of EIPs and ERCs on the Ethereum network. It designates a field called majorEIPIdentifier, which is similar to the EIP number, and proposes a new concept of minorEIPIdentifier. It also proposes an event to allow smart contracts to declare the EIPs they support. This proposal is meant to be a competing standard for EIP-165 and was designed with UX in mind.
