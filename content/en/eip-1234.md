EIP-1234 proposes to delay the difficulty bomb for approximately 12 months and reduce the block rewards with the Constantinople fork, the second part of the Metropolis fork. The difficulty bomb, also known as the "ice age," is causing the average block times to increase, and delaying it for another year would allow the Ethash proof-of-work to remain feasible for miners and maintain stability of the system. To offset the delay, the block reward would be reduced to a base of 2 ETH, and uncle and nephew rewards would be adjusted accordingly. The proposal aims to prevent sudden increases in miner rewards and decrease the likelihood of a miner-driven chain split as Ethereum approaches proof-of-stake. The specification involves replacing the use of block.number with a fake block number in the exponential ice age component for calc_difficulty and adjusting the block, uncle, and nephew rewards. The proposal is part of the Standards Track: Core and is intended to maintain the stability and efficiency of the Ethereum network.
