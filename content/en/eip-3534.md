## Summary

EIP-3534 proposes a new transaction type with constraints on ancestor block hash, block author, and/or block timestamp. This is achieved through the addition of a new element called chainContext, which adds a constraint on the validity of a transaction to a chain segment meeting the referenced value(s). Four contexts are defined as subclasses of this type: segmentId, eligibleMinerList, ineligibleMinerList, and expiry. These contexts can be used in arbitrary combinations and are referenced by a composite integer prefix on the annotation. The motivation behind this proposal is to establish a protocol-based mechanism with which transactions are able to articulate constraints on eligible chain contexts, giving the transactor an ability to express requirements about the transactionâs relationship to blockchain data and its provenance. This proposal also introduces a way for transactions to describe a dependency on their current view of a chain and restrict transaction applicability to a chain context following some foregoing block (and its transactions). The proposal acknowledges that the validation costs associated with ancestorId demands the assertion of a positive database hit by block number, which can be cached but may not always result in a hit. The proposal also notes that the proposed additional fields potentially increase transaction size, but they are not associated with any gas costs, establishing no protocol-defined economic mitigation for potential spam. However, transactions which are considered by a miner to be undesirable can be simply dropped from the transaction pool and ignored.
