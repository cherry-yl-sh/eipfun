EIP-2330 proposes the addition of a new opcode called EXTSLOAD to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This opcode allows a contract to read the storage of another contract, which breaks the traditional object-oriented model used in smart contracts. However, this change can make smart contract systems more efficient and prevent misconceptions about private variables. The proposal is fully backwards compatible and should not pose any security issues. The motivation behind this proposal is to address the under-pricing of opcodes that read the state tree, which can be used for denial-of-service attacks. The EXTSLOAD opcode adds a flat penalty of 300 gas on top of the costs calculated in a table to account for the cost of loading the code. The goal is to target a limit of 8 MB of data that needs to be read in order to process a block and include an estimate of 500 bytes for a Merkle proof for SLOAD and 1000 for an account. Overall, the proposal aims to increase the cost of storage reading opcodes to mitigate the risk of transaction spam and improve network performance.
