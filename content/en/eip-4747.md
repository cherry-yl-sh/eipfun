EIP-4747 aims to simplify EIP-161 by removing the requirement for implementors to support edge cases that are impossible on Ethereum Mainnet. EIP-161 is considered overly complex and has poorly documented and tested edge cases. EIP-4747 takes advantage of the complete removal of all remaining empty accounts in block 14049881 to clarify EIP-161 and allows implementors to not implement various edge cases that never occurred and are not possible in the future. This EIP permits implementors who do not wish to support historical blocks to not implement state clearing at all. The retroactive replacement of EIP-161 starts from its introduction in block 2675000 and includes setting the nonce of a newly created account to 1 prior to executing initcode. The key words used in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.
