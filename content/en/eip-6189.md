The EIP-6189 proposal suggests the implementation of Alias Contracts in Ethereum. Alias Contracts would allow for the creation of a contract that acts as a proxy for another contract, allowing for easier upgrades and maintenance of the original contract without disrupting its functionality. The proposal outlines the technical specifications for Alias Contracts, including the ability to delegate calls to the original contract, the ability to upgrade the original contract while maintaining its address, and the ability to transfer ownership of the Alias Contract. Overall, the proposal aims to improve the flexibility and maintainability of smart contracts on the Ethereum network.
