EIP-2938 proposes the concept of account abstraction (AA) which allows a contract to be the top-level account that pays fees and starts transaction execution. This extends the validity conditions of transactions with the execution of arbitrary EVM bytecode, with some limits on what state may be accessed. To signal validity, a new EVM opcode PAYGAS is proposed, which also sets the gas price and gas limit the contract is willing to pay. Account abstraction is split into two tiers: single-tenant AA, which is intended to support wallets or other use cases with few participants, and multi-tenant AA, which is intended to support applications with many participants. The existing limitations preclude innovation in a number of important areas, particularly peer denial-of-service. Denial-of-Service attacks are difficult to defend against, due to the difficulty in identifying sybils within a peer list. At any moment, one may decide (or be bribed) to initiate an attack. This is not a problem that Account Abstraction introduces. It can be accomplished against existing clients today by inundating a target with transactions whose signatures are invalid. However, due to the increased allotment of validation work allowed by AA, itâs important to bound the amount of computation an adversary can force a client to expend with invalid transactions. For this reason, itâs best for the miner to follow the recommended mining strategies.
