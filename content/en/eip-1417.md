ERC-1417 is a proposal for a standard interface for polls to be used with Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1261, which is the Minimum Viable Token (MVT) standard. The poll standard aims to modularize blockchain voting by breaking down a poll into four building blocks: voterbase qualification, vote weight calculation, vote consequences, and vote tallying. This modularization makes it easy for developers to change parts of a poll without disrupting other parts and helps people understand code written in the same format by other people. The poll standard also leverages EIP-1261 to clear the permissioning hurdle, allowing for more creative poll structures in terms of vote weightage and improving flexibility in permissioning by allowing developers to combine several entities and read attributes from entities. The vote weight module of the poll standard can be used effectively to design various kinds of poll contracts which function differently and are suited to different environments, such as quadratic voting, karma voting, delegated voting, token-based voting, and one person one vote systems. Additionally, the poll standard records the number of voters in each proposal, which helps in figuring out concentration of power and tracing malicious parties to a larger extent. Overall, the poll standard provides a common interface for polls that have different kinds of building blocks, making it possible to make interactive front-end applications that can seamlessly get data from a poll contract in order to bring transparency into consensus and decision making on the blockchain.
