The ERC-2333 proposal outlines a method for deriving a tree-hierarchy of BLS12-381 keys based on an entropy seed, providing a practically limitless number of keys for different purposes while only requiring knowledge of a single ancestor key in the tree. It also includes a post-quantum cryptographic fallback in the form of a Lamport signature scheme in case BLS12-381 is ever deemed insecure. The proposal aims to establish a multi-chain standard early on and be adopted by the wider community who have adopted BLS signatures over BLS12-381.
