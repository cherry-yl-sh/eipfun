The ERC-6900 proposal standardizes smart contract accounts and account plugins, which are smart contract interfaces that allow for composable logic within smart contract accounts. This modular approach splits account functionality into three categories, delegates them to external contracts, and defines an expected execution flow from accounts. The proposal defines a modular smart contract account capable of supporting all standard-conformant plugins, allowing users to have greater portability of their data, and for plugin developers to not have to choose specific wallet implementations to support. The proposal takes inspiration from ERC-2535’s diamond pattern and adopts a similar composability by proposing three types of plugins: validation functions, execution functions, and hooks. Validation functions validate the caller’s authenticity and authority to the account, execution functions execute any custom logic allowed by the account, and hooks execute custom logic and checks before and/or after an execution function. The proposal aims to provide standards for how validation, execution, and hook functions for smart contract accounts should be written, and how compliant accounts should add, update, remove, and inspect plugins. Defining this as a standard for smart contract accounts will make plugins easier to develop securely and will allow for greater interoperability.
