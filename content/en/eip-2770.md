## Summary

The ERC-2770 is a standardized contract interface for meta-transaction forwarding on the Ethereum blockchain. It defines an external API for a Forwarder contract that validates transaction signatures on-chain and exposes the signer to the destination contract. This allows externally owned accounts without ETH to pay for gas to still interact with Ethereum contracts through meta-transactions. The ERC-712 structure of the forwarding request can be extended to allow wallets to display readable data for types not known during the Forwarder contract deployment. The Forwarder contract can be used by multiple Gas Relays and Relay Recipient contracts, improving reliability and security of any participating meta-transaction framework and avoiding on-chain code duplication. The ERC-2771 is a related proposal that defines a secure protocol for native meta-transactions, allowing Ethereum contracts to accept calls from externally owned accounts that do not have ETH to pay for gas. It includes definitions for Transaction Signers, Gas Relays, and Trusted Forwarders, and specifies the requirements for each. The ERC-3005 is a draft proposal for batched meta-transactions, which would allow multiple meta-transactions to be bundled together and executed in a single transaction, reducing gas costs and improving efficiency.
