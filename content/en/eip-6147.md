The ERC-6147 proposal is an extension of ERC-721 that separates the holding right and transfer right of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) and defines a new role called guard with an expiration date. The guard setting enables the design of NFT anti-theft, NFT lending, NFT leasing, SBT, and other applications. The motivation behind this proposal is to address the current issues with NFT theft and lending, where NFTs are inconvenient to use and the owner loses the right to use the NFT while obtaining a loan. The proposal also aims to address the lack of standards for SBTs, which are currently bound to an Ether address and become difficult to retrieve when the private key of the user address is lost or leaked. The proposal suggests setting an appropriate expires for the guard based on the specific application scenario and recommends preventing the listing of NFTs with a valid guard on trading platforms. Overall, the ERC-6147 proposal aims to provide more flexibility and security for NFTs and SBTs.
