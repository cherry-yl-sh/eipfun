ERC-2981 is a proposal for a standardized way to retrieve royalty payment information for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to enable universal support for royalty payments across all NFT marketplaces and ecosystem participants. This standard allows contracts, such as NFTs that support ERC-721 and ERC-1155 interfaces, to signal a royalty amount to be paid to the NFT creator or rights holder every time the NFT is sold or re-sold. The royalty payment must be voluntary, and marketplaces and individuals can implement this standard by retrieving the royalty payment information with royaltyInfo(). The exact mechanism for paying and notifying the recipient will be defined in future EIPs. Without an agreed royalty payment standard, the NFT ecosystem will lack an effective means to collect royalties across all marketplaces and artists and other creators will not receive ongoing funding. Enabling all NFT marketplaces to unify on a single royalty payment standard will benefit the entire NFT ecosystem.
