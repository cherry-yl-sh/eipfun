EIP-198 is a proposal to add a precompile to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) that allows for efficient big integer modular exponentiation. This is useful for number theory-based cryptography, such as RSA verification. The precompile takes input in a specific format and returns the result of (BASE**EXPONENT) % MODULUS as a byte array with the same length as the modulus. The gas cost is calculated based on the length of the input and the complexity of the multiplication algorithm used. The proposal was made by Vitalik Buterin in January 2017.
