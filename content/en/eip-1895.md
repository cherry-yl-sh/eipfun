EIP-1895 proposes the implementation of support for an elliptic curve cycle in Ethereum. The idea is to use a cycle of elliptic curves to improve the efficiency of recursive SNARKs, which are used for privacy-preserving transactions. The proposal suggests that only one curve from the cycle needs to be implemented, and the choice should be based on speed rather than security, as the overall security of the SNARK does not depend on the curve used for verification. Proper benchmarks will be conducted to determine the best curve and to price the operations in gas. The proposal references two papers on cycles of elliptic curves and suggests using the go-boojum and libff libraries for implementation. The proposal also mentions the coda cryptocurrency protocol, which uses a lightweight, constant-sized blockchain. The document includes a waiver of copyright and related rights via CC0.
