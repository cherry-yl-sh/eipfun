EIP-1829 proposes a new precompile for elliptic curve linear combinations, which would allow for more efficient implementation of privacy-preserving protocols on the Ethereum blockchain. The precompile would support point addition, scalar multiplication, and multiexponentiation operations over elliptic curves in the Weierstrass form with curve parameters defined at runtime. The proposal also includes possible simplifications to the implementation and outlines the rationale for the precompile. Backwards compatibility and test cases are also discussed, and preliminary benchmarks are provided.
