The ERC-4400: EIP-721 Consumable Extension is a standard for implementing a consumer role for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that allows for actions beyond ownership. This standard allows for the creation of custom roles that grant permissions for utilizing or consuming a given NFT instance, such as authorizing other addresses to deploy scenes on land in metaverses. The standard enables protocols to integrate and build on top of dApps that issue EIP-721 tokens, including the creation of generic/universal NFT renting marketplaces. Implementors of the standard must consider the permissions they give to consumers and restrict them to owners only. The standard is compatible with user interfaces and contracts, and it enables the "staker" (owner of the NFT) to have access to the utility benefits even after transferring their NFT to the staking contract. The ERC-4400: EIP-721 Consumable Extension is part of the Ethereum Improvement Proposals and is available online for reference.
