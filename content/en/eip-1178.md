## Summary

The ERC-1178: Multi-class Token Standard is a standard interface for multi-class fungible tokens within smart contracts. This standard allows for the implementation of a standard API to track and transfer ownership of MCF Ts. MCF Ts are tokens that can be divided into multiple classes, each with its own supply and balance. This is different from traditional fungible tokens, such as ERC-20, which have a single supply and balance. ERC-1178 provides basic functionality for MCF Ts, including the ability to create new classes of tokens, mint new tokens within those classes, transfer ownership of tokens between addresses, and query the balance of a specific class or address. The standard also includes advanced ownership and exchange features, such as the ability to approve third-party addresses to transfer tokens on behalf of an owner and the ability to exchange one class of token for another at a predetermined rate. While ERC-1178 follows the semantics of ERC-721 as closely as possible, it cannot be entirely compatible with it due to fundamental differences between multi-class fungible and non-fungible tokens. For example, certain methods in ERC-721 cannot be implemented in this standard due to these differences. Overall, ERC-1178 provides a standardized way for developers to create and manage multi-class fungible tokens within their smart contracts.
