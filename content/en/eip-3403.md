## Summary

The proposal in EIP-3403 is to partially remove gas refunds for SELFDESTRUCT and restrict gas refunds for SSTORE to only one specific case. The motivation behind this is that gas refunds have multiple harmful consequences, including the creation of GasToken and increasing block size variance. The proposal suggests that disused storage slots and contracts would start to be ignored automatically with the implementation of some form of statelessness or state expiry.
