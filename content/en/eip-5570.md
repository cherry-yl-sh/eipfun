ERC-5570 proposes a standard schema for digital receipts of transactions using Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). These NFTs are issued by vendors when a customer makes a purchase from their store and contain transaction details necessary for record keeping. Digital receipts have never gained traction despite the fact that point of sales systems are already digital and customers often want this information in their own digital systems. Digital receipts are relatively simple and can be specified with a schema that can be parsed into JSON or other structured formats. In addition, the receipts' validity can be proven by digitally signing them using the vendors' private keys. NFT receipts are first-class citizens of a transaction reflecting the goods changing ownership as part of the transaction state. They will bring our on-chain transaction state in line with the changes happening in the real world. The data stored in the digital receipt includes various types of personally identifying information (PII), such as the vendor's name, contact details, and the items purchased. Protecting the privacy of the customer is of utmost importance, as unauthorized access to PII can lead to identity theft, fraud, or other malicious activities. To ensure the privacy of the customer, it is crucial to encrypt the PII contained within the digital receipt. By encrypting the PII, only authorized parties with the appropriate decryption keys can access and read the information stored in the digital receipt. This ensures that the customer's privacy is maintained, and their data is protected from potential misuse.
