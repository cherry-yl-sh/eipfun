The Clique proof-of-authority consensus protocol is a proposed solution for Ethereum's testnet issues, specifically the vulnerability of proof-of-work networks to attacks. It differs from other consensus protocols in that it relies on a group of authorized signers rather than computational power to validate transactions and create new blocks. This allows for a more secure and efficient network, as well as easier implementation across different clients.
