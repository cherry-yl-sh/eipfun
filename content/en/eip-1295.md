EIP-1295 proposes to delay the Difficulty Bomb and adjust Uncle and Nephew rewards to reduce ancillary ETH issuance while keeping the current block reward constant at 3 ETH. The client will calculate the difficulty based on a fake block number suggesting the client that the difficulty bomb is adjusting around 6 million blocks later than previously specified with the Homestead fork. This EIP is not forward compatible and introduces backwards incompatibilities in the difficulty calculation, as well as the block, uncle and nephew reward structure, so it should be included in a scheduled hardfork at a certain block number, such as the second Metropolis hard-fork, Constantinople. Test cases have not been completed yet and no implementation including both block reward and difficulty adjustment is currently available.
