ERC-1812 proposes a new method for off-chain verifiable claims built on EIP-712. These claims can be issued by any user with an EIP 712 compatible web3 provider and can be stored off-chain and verified on-chain by Solidity smart contracts, state channel implementations, or off-chain libraries. The motivation behind this proposal is to provide a way to integrate smart contracts with real-world organizational requirements such as meeting regulatory requirements like KYC, GDPR, and accredited investor rules. While ERC-735 and ERC-780 provide methods of making claims that live on-chain, it is dangerous and sometimes illegal to record identity claims containing personal identifying information on an immutable public database like the Ethereum blockchain. The proposal suggests using the W3C Verifiable Claims Data Model and Representations as well as uPorts Verification Message Spec as off-chain solutions. The proposal also includes test cases, example verifiers, and smart contracts to demonstrate the implementation of the proposal. The EIP-712 domain is used to create verifiable claims domains, and key delegation is used to delegate the signing of claims to a third party. The proposal also includes a revocation mechanism for claims that have been compromised or are no longer valid. Overall, ERC-1812 aims to provide a way to issue and verify off-chain verifiable claims that can be used in a variety of real-world scenarios while maintaining privacy and security.
