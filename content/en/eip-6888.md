## Summary

EIP-6888, titled "Math checking in EVM," proposes the addition of checks in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) for arithmetic underflows, overflows, and division by zero. The proposal introduces two new flags to the EVM state: unsigned error (carry) and signed error (overflow). Each frame of execution has its own flags, which are unset at the frame creation and updated in call.

The proposal also introduces two new opcodes, JUMPC and JUMPO, which conditionally alter the program counter and clear the carry and overflow flags. The gas cost for both instructions is the same as JUMPI.

The rationale behind this proposal is to improve the safety and efficiency of smart contracts by bringing math checks to the EVM level. The document mentions that this proposal introduces backward-incompatible changes to the EVM behavior and must be accompanied by a hard fork. The test cases, reference implementation, and security considerations are yet to be determined.
