## Summary

The EIP-6190 proposal aims to change the behavior of the SELFDESTRUCT instruction in Ethereum to only cause a finite number of state changes. Currently, SELFDESTRUCT has a fixed price but is unbounded in storage/account changes, which has been a concern for some time. With Verkle trees, accounts will be organized differently, making it challenging to support SELFDESTRUCT. Therefore, this proposal is a step towards supporting SELFDESTRUCT in Verkle trees. The proposal suggests that instead of destroying the contract at the end of the transaction, the contract's code will be set to 0x1, and its nonce will be set to 2^64-1. This proposal requires the use of EIP-6188 and EIP-6189 to function correctly. On the other hand, the EIP-6049 proposal aims to deprecate the SELFDESTRUCT opcode and warns against its use. It suggests that a breaking change to this functionality is likely to come in the future. The motivation behind this proposal is ongoing discussions about how to change SELFDESTRUCT, and there is a strong consensus that something will change. This proposal updates non-normative text in the Yellow Paper and does not require any changes to clients.
