The ERC-4353 is a draft proposal for an interface that allows for staked tokens in non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This proposal aims to enable NFTs to be used as collateral for loans or other financial instruments by allowing the staking of tokens within the NFT. The interface would allow for the staked tokens to be locked within the NFT until certain conditions are met, such as the repayment of a loan. This would provide a new use case for NFTs and potentially increase their value as a financial asset. However, as it is still a draft proposal, it is subject to change and has not yet been implemented on the Ethereum network.
