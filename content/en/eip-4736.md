EIP-4736 proposes the introduction of a new type of object called "withdrawal operation" to protect against certain types of attacks on the Ethereum network. These operations are initiated by the system rather than end users and are designed to simplify testing and security review of withdrawals. The proposal suggests that the withdrawal type should not have any gas costs as the maximum number of withdrawals that can reach the execution layer at a given time is bounded and the additional payload footprint is kept small. The proposal also suggests that only balance updates should be allowed in withdrawal operations to minimize complexity and reduce the risk of failures. The proposal does not have any backwards compatibility issues and emphasizes the need for high security scrutiny of the consensus-layer to execution-layer ETH transfer. Overall, EIP-4736 aims to improve the security and efficiency of the Ethereum network by introducing a new type of object that is specifically designed for withdrawals.
