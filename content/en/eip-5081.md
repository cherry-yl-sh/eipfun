EIP-5081, titled "Expirable Trainsaction," proposes the introduction of a new transaction type that includes an expiration block number. The motivation behind this proposal is to address the issue of transactions with low gas prices that might not be executed immediately. Currently, there's no clean way to cancel such transactions, except for signing a new transaction with the same nonce but a higher gas fee, hoping it will preempt the original transaction. This method can be both unreliable and costly.

The proposal specifies that a new EIP-2718 transaction is introduced with a TransactionType that includes an expiration block number. If a transaction is not executed by the specified block number, it is considered expired and will not be processed.

The document also introduces a new execution state in EVM for these expirable transactions. The rationale behind this proposal is to prevent wastage of resources on transactions that are likely to fail due to changes in network conditions. The document mentions that there are no known backward compatibility issues associated with this proposal. The test cases, reference implementation, and security considerations are yet to be determined.
