The proposal in EIP-3372 is to introduce 5 new FNV primes into the ethash algorithm in order to kick current ASIC implementations out of the network and keep the Ethereum network secure and healthy. ASICs provide a severe centralization risk for the Ethereum network, and if they are not eliminated, small GPU miners will be forced to exit the Ethereum mining because EIP-1559 will make them mining at a loss. Furthermore, ASIC production will be concentrated only at one or two parties, which will make the Ethereum hashrate centralized. The proposal suggests that Ethash ASIC machines cost 10k+ USD, while GPUs are priced less than 1000 USD, and with GPUs, miners can switch to other mining algorithms, but with ASICs, it is impossible. The proposal aims to keep the Ethereum network stable and decentralized by keeping the ASIC business away. The proposal suggests that if block.number >= ETHASH11_BLKNUM, activate the ethash1.1 algorithm version. Prior to this EIP, all parts of Ethash are using the fnv (hereinafter referenced as fnv0) function. As of the introduction of this EIP, fnvA replaces fnv0 in the DAG item selection step, and fnvB replaces fnv0 in the DAG item mix step. Ethash 1.1 will replace the only FNV prime with five new primes at the stage of the hash computation. The prime used for the DAG generation is remained unchanged, while all others are be changed. This will not prevent ASIC companies from creating new ASICs that adapt but so close to the merge it is unlikely they will do so, and even if they do they are unlikely to be able to produce enough to again be a threat. The choice of FNV constants are based on the formal specification that is available on https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-eastlake-fnv-14#section-2.1. The proposal suggests that mining hardware that is optimized for ethash may no longer work if the fnv constants are baked into the hardware and cannot be changed.
