## Summary

The ERC-6464 proposal extends the ERC-721 standard to allow token owners to approve multiple operators to control their assets on a per-token basis. This fine-grained, on-chain approval mechanism removes unnecessary access permissions and reduces the surface for exploits. The proposal includes an efficient mechanism for broad revocation of approvals via incrementing nonces. The extended contracts remain fully compatible with all existing platforms. The proposal also notes security considerations, including the interplay with setApprovalForAll() and other risks. The reference implementation is yet to be added. The proposal aims to address the security risks associated with the current predominant way of authorizing operators, setApprovalForAll(), which grants the approved address control over all assets and has been exploited in phishing attacks.
