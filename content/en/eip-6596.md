ERC-6596 proposes a new metadata standard for Historical Asset Tokens (HATs) on the Ethereum platform. HATs are tokens that represent a specific historical asset, such as a collectible or a rare item, and provide comprehensive context and provenance needed to establish historical significance and value. The proposal suggests extending the EIP-721 metadata schema for backward compatibility, as most projects on Ethereum use non-upgradeable contracts. Leveraging EIP-721âs existing metadata field minimizes the number of changes necessary. The proposal includes a Historical Asset Metadata Extension TypeScript Interface and a Historical Asset Metadata JSON Schema to enhance the discoverability, connectivity, and collectability of historically significant NFTs. Existing projects that canât modify the metadata response (schema) may be able to create a new smart contract that based on the tokenId returns the updated metadata schema. The proposal also includes security considerations related to using http gateways or IPFS for the tokenURI method. Copyright and related rights are waived via CC0.
