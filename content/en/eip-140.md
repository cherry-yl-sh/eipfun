## Summary

The EIP-140 proposal introduces the REVERT instruction in the Ethereum Virtual Machine, which allows for the stopping of execution and the ability to revert state changes without consuming all provided gas. It also provides the ability to return a reason for the aborting of an EVM execution, which was not previously possible. This aims to improve the functionality of smart contracts by providing a more efficient and informative way to handle errors and abort transactions.
