ERC-5298 proposes a standardized interface for smart contracts to hold EIP-721 and EIP-1155 tokens on behalf of ENS domains, decoupling NFT ownership from wallet addresses. The compliant contract must implement ERC721TokenReceiver and the IERC_ENS_TRUST interface, which includes a claimTo function that checks if the sender is the owner of the ENS node and makes a call to the safeTransferFrom function of EIP-721 or EIP-1155. Any ensNode is allowed, and the proposal is compatible with other scoped ownership namespaces.
