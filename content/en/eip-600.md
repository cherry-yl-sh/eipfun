The ERC-600 proposal defines a logical hierarchy for deterministic wallets based on BIP32, with a purpose set to 43 for non-bitcoin cryptocurrencies, a subpurpose set to 60 for Ethereum, and an EIP number specifying the remainder of the BIP32 derivation path.

It is expected to cause relatively little disruption and potentially improve matters significantly in the long run. However, there are no test cases or implementation yet.
