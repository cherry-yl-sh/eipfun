The ERC-5114 proposal introduces the concept of a Soulbound Badge, which is a token that is bound to another Non-Fungible Token (NFT) at the time of minting and cannot be transferred or moved after that. The proposal includes an interface called IERC5114, which includes a Mint event that is fired every time a new instance of the badge is minted. The event includes the badge ID, the address of the NFT it is bound to, and the ID of that NFT. The proposal also includes a function called ownerOf, which returns the address of the NFT that the badge is bound to. Additionally, there is a function called collectionUri, which returns a URI with details about the badge collection. The metadata returned by this function is merged with the metadata returned by the badgeUri function, and the collectionUri must be immutable and content addressable. The proposal emphasizes the immutability of the Soulbound Badge and the importance of content addressable URIs. The proposal is currently in the process of being peer-reviewed.
