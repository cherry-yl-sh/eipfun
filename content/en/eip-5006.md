## Summary

ERC-5006 proposes a new type of NFT that can be leased or rented out to others for a specific period of time. This is achieved by separating ownership and usage rights, and creating "expirable" NFTs that can be automatically withdrawn upon expiration through smart contract. The proposal also introduces a new role called "user" which represents permission to "use" the NFT, but not the ability to transfer it or set users. This allows for separate permissions and actions for owners and users of the NFT. The proposal aims to create a decentralized, collateral-free, and purely "on-chain" leasing model for NFTs, which could disrupt the way people trade and use NFTs.
