## Summary

The ERC-4546 proposal is for a singleton contract that manages asset deposits (Ether, ERC-20, ERC-721) on behalf of a user. The current process for depositing assets in dapps is inconvenient and insecure, requiring users to send approve transactions for every subsequent deposit or for an infinite spend amount. The wrapped deposit contract simplifies this process by allowing a user to approve a spend limit once and then deposit assets to any number of different applications that support deposits from the contract. The contract should be deployed at an identifiable address and must be non-upgradable with no ability for state variables to be changed. The contract includes public functions for depositing ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155 assets, as well as a batch deposit function for ERC-1155 assets.
