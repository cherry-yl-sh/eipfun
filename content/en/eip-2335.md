## Summary

ERC-2335 proposes a JSON format for the storage and exchange of BLS12-381 private keys, which is a mechanism for storing private keys that encrypts them until a user provides their password. The proposal aims to be an Ethereum 2.0 standard and one that is adopted by the wider community who have adopted the BLS12-381 signature standard. The motivation behind this proposal is to provide a secure storage and exchange of keys, which is a vital component of the user experience as people are expected to hold their own keys. The proposal addresses the deficiencies of the existing standard, which uses Keccak256, a sensible choice considering its usage within Ethereum 1, but not suitable for inter-chain standards. The proposal also aims to eventually migrate to a more neutral repository in the future.
