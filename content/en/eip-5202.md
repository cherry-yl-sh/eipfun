The ERC-5202 proposal aims to define a bytecode container format for indexing and utilizing blueprint contracts. Blueprint contracts are contracts that represent initcode that is stored on-chain, which can be used to decrease deployer contract size. However, storing initcode byte-for-byte on-chain poses security and correctness problems, as anyone can call such a "blueprint" contract and execute the initcode directly as ordinary runtime code. To address this, the ERC-5202 proposal suggests prefixing blueprint contracts with a special preamble to prevent execution. The proposal also aims to define a standard for blueprint contracts to make it easier for external tools and indexers to detect them. Overall, the ERC-5202 proposal aims to provide a standardized and secure way to utilize blueprint contracts on the Ethereum network.
