The ERC-820 standard defines a universal registry smart contract where any address (contract or regular account) can register which interface it supports and which smart contract is responsible for its implementation. This allows anyone to query the registry to ask if a specific address implements a given interface and which smart contract handles its implementation. The registry can be deployed on any chain and shares the same address on all chains, and it also acts as an ERC-165 cache to reduce gas consumption. Its purpose is to provide a simpler and fully decentralized approach to pseudo-introspection in Ethereum, compared to previous attempts such as ERC-165 and ERC-672.
