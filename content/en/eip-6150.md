## Summary

ERC-6150 proposes an extension to the EIP-721 standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to support hierarchical relationships among NFTs. The proposal suggests a filesystem-like structure where each NFT can be a parent or child node, and the hierarchy can be managed by a single smart contract. The standard provides interfaces to get parent NFTs or children NFTs and to determine whether an NFT is a leaf or root node. The proposal also includes extensions for enumerable queries, parent transferability, and access control. The standard is fully backward compatible with EIP-721 and can be used for various use cases, including e-commerce and forums. The proposal suggests that the advantages of using this standard include complete on-chain storage of hierarchy, easy and permissionless data access to the hierarchical structure by front-end, and easy-to-understand interfaces for developers. The proposal also provides a reference implementation for the standard.
