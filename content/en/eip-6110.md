EIP-6110 proposes to append validator deposits to the Execution Layer block structure, which shifts responsibility of deposit inclusion and validation to the Execution Layer and removes the need for deposit voting from the Consensus Layer. This allows for an in-protocol mechanism of deposit processing on the Consensus Layer and eliminates the proposer voting mechanism utilized currently. The proposed mechanism relaxes safety assumptions and reduces complexity of client software design, contributing to the security of the deposits flow and improving validator UX. The validator deposits list supplied in a block is obtained by parsing deposit contract log events emitted by each deposit transaction included in a given block. The data complexity introduced by this proposal is negligible and adding deposit operations to a block does not increase Execution Layer DoS attack surface. The minimum deposit amount is 1 ETH and the lowest cost of a byte of deposit data is several orders of magnitude higher than the cost of a byte of transactionâs calldata. The proposal is backwards compatible and does not limit the size of deposit operations list.
