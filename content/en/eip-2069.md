The summary of EIP-2069 is a recommendation for including contract ABI descriptions in EIPs and ERCs as YAML. This proposal aims to solve issues such as preferring a single language over others and locking the specification to a certain version of the Solidity language. The Standard Contract ABI is usually represented as a JSON object, but YAML is suggested for providing user-readable specifications with comments. The aim was to choose a representation which is well supported by tools and supports comments. The proposal has no effect on backwards compatibility.
