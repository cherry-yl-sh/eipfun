## Summary

EIP-2045 proposes the introduction of a new minimum gas unit called a "particle" for EVM opcodes. This is because current gas costs for computation opcodes are generally overpriced relative to storage I/O opcodes, and the range of possible cost reduction is limited by the current minimum gas cost of 1. By introducing particles, which are fractions of 1 gas, the range of gas costs can be expanded and enable reductions below the current minimum. This would allow for cost reductions for many computational opcodes, with new costs suggested by benchmark analyses. The concept of particles need not be exposed to Ethereum users or most contract authors, but only to EVM implementers and contract developers concerned with optimized gas usage. The adoption of fractional gas costs should only be an implementation detail inside the EVM and not alter the current user experience around transaction gas limits and block gas limits. This change is not backwards compatible and requires a hard fork to be activated.
