The EIP-2014 proposal introduces a new system contract called the Extended State Oracle (ESO) with an extensible interface to access extended data sets, such as chain identifiers and block hashes, using the Contract ABI Encoding. This allows smart contracts to interact with the ESO as if it were a regular contract without needing any language support. The proposal aims to improve the efficiency and security of accessing off-chain data in smart contracts on the Ethereum network by providing a standardized interface for accessing such data.
