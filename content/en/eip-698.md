EIP-698 proposes the addition of a new opcode, 0x46 BLOCKREWARD, to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This opcode would return the block reward for any finalized block, including the base reward, uncle payments, and gas. The motivation behind this proposal is to provide a consensus system agnostic solution that is useful for decentralized pool operations and any contract that benefits from knowing a block reward payout, such as merge mined tokens. The specification for this opcode is that after block n, all clients should process it as follows: Value: 0x46, Mnemonic: BLOCKREWARD, Î´: 0 (nothing removed from stack), Î±: 1 (block reward added to stack), Description: Get the block's reward emission, GasCost: Gbase, Where: Âµ's[0] â¡ IHR. The rationale behind this proposal is that it would be useful for contract mining pools, where ad hoc groups combine resources to reduce variance in payouts. The proposal is backwards compatible with currently deployed contracts and current clients. The implementation details are not provided in this EIP, but further reading is suggested for those interested.
