The EIP-999 proposal suggests restoring the WalletLibrary contract code at 0x863DF6BFa4469f3ead0bE8f9F2AAE51c91A907b4 with a patched version after it was accidentally self-destructed, causing significant amounts of Ether and other assets owned by many different parties to be inaccessible. The proposal aims to enable the affected users and companies to regain access to their tokens and Ether without changing any EVM semantics and introducing unwanted side-effects and potential risks to the existing smart-contract ecosystem on the Ethereum platform. The proposal introduces backwards incompatibilities in the state of the contract at 0x863DF6BFa4469f3ead0bE8f9F2AAE51c91A907b4 and requires the necessary state transition to be added in a future hard-fork at a well-defined block number. The potential impact of the proposal is to unfreeze the funds and allow the owners of the dependent multi-signature wallets to regain access to their assets.
