EIP-3690 proposes the introduction of a special EOF section for storing the list of JUMPDESTs, which simplifies execution time analysis. Currently, every time existing contracts are executed, a list must be built containing all the valid jump-destinations, which is an overhead that can be avoided. With the structure provided by EIP-3540, it is easy to store and transmit a table of valid jump-destinations instead of using designated JUMPDEST opcodes in the code. This change aims to trade less complexity and processing time at execution time for more complexity at contract creation time. The new instructions are not introduced for legacy bytecode, and the new execution state and multi-section control flow pose no risk to backwards compatibility. The authors are not aware of any security or DoS risks posed by this change. The proposal also suggests repurposing JUMPDEST as a NOP instruction, which can be useful for off-chain tooling. Overall, the proposal aims to improve the efficiency of contract execution by simplifying the process of building a list of valid jump-destinations.
