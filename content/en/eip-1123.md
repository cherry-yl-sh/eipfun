ERC-1123 is a revised Ethereum Smart Contract Packaging Standard proposed in June 2018. It defines a data format for package manifest documents representing a package of one or more smart contracts, including source code and any/all deployed instances across multiple networks. It is related to smart contract packaging on the Ethereum network as it aims to provide a standard for packaging smart contracts, which can increase productivity and security by allowing developers to reuse existing code and well-audited implementations of common patterns. However, it has been abandoned in favor of the EthPM V3 smart contract packaging standard defined in ERC-2678.
