## Summary

The EIP-6206 proposal introduces a new instruction called JUMPF for chaining function calls in Ethereum. It allows for tail call optimizations in EOF functions (EIP-4750) by jumping to a code section without adding a new return stack frame. JUMPF has one immediate argument, code_section_index, encoded as a 16-bit unsigned big-endian value, and costs 5 gas. It neither pops nor pushes anything to the operand stack. The proposal also includes specifications for execution semantics, code validation, rationale, backwards compatibility, and security considerations.
