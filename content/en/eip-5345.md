The EIP-5345 proposal introduces a new feature called Silent Signing for mobile applications that interact with a blockchain frequently, such as gaming applications. This feature allows transactions to be signed and sent without user participation, improving the user experience. The proposal introduces new RPC methods for the ethereum JSON-RPC, including wallet_requestSilentSign and wallet_silentSendTransaction. The Silent Signing process involves the application requesting the wallet to use Silent Signing, the wallet prompting the user to confirm enabling the feature for a specific time duration, and subsequent transactions being sent using the wallet_silentSendTransaction method. The proposal includes security considerations, such as the feature only being enabled with user consent and having restrictions on the time duration and specific contract and functions. The proposal does not interfere with current RPC methods and is backward compatible.
