## Summary

EIP-1884 proposes to reprice trie-size-dependent opcodes in order to address the issue of denial-of-service attacks that have shown that these opcodes are under-priced relative to other opcodes. The concern is that such opcodes will be the easiest known mechanism to degrade network performance via transaction spam. The EIP increases the cost of storage reading opcodes to target a limit of 8 MB of data that needs to be read in order to process a block. The costs have been derived from an updated version of the calculation table used to generate the 1.0 gas costs. The EIP adds a flat penalty of 300 gas on top of the costs calculated in this table to account for the cost of loading the code. The risks associated with this change can be mitigated by the existence of an accessed_addresses and accessed_storage_keys map, which makes some cases recoverable. Another possibility is to add a POKE precompile, which would allow transactions that attempt to "rescue" stuck contracts by pre-poking all of the storage slots that they will access. EIP-2930 is another option that would have a similar effect to POKE but is more general.
