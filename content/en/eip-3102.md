EIP-3102 proposes a new binary structure and merkelization rule for the account and storage tries in Ethereum, which are merged into a single "state" trie. The current hexary trie design is replaced with a binary trie structure, which makes for smaller proofs and is more stateless-friendly. The proposal also drops RLP and most of the MPT's optimizations to simplify the design, and replaces Keccak256 with blake2b. The motivation behind this proposal is to address the bottleneck of disk accesses in Ethereum's storage model, and to make Ethereum easier to use in a stateless fashion. However, there are security considerations to be aware of, such as the potential for lowered network security during the transition process. A transition process has been proposed with EIP-2584. Overall, EIP-3102 aims to improve the efficiency and usability of Ethereum's storage structure.
