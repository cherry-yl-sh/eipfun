ERC-1203 is a proposed standard for multi-class tokens (MCTs) within smart contracts. It is an extension of the ERC-20 Token Standard and is fully compatible with existing wallets and exchanges. MCTs are tokens that are fungible within the same class but non-fungible with tokens from a different class. This allows for representing complex structures with heterogeneous components, such as different classes of stocks or resources in a virtual game. The standard provides basic functionality for tracking, transferring, and converting MCTs. The implementation includes a "lowest common denominator" class and a default class for tracking or transferring, unless otherwise specified. The optional methods of the ERC-20 Token Standard, name(), symbol(), and decimals(), are not required but can be implemented as desired. The proposal also introduces the concept of cross class conversion and dilution, making each token class an integral part of a whole system rather than many silos. Sample test cases and implementation can be found in the repository at jeffishjeff/ERC-1203.
