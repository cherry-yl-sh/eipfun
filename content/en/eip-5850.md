ERC-5850 proposes a standard for storing complex numbers in the `bytes32` data type in Ethereum. The proposal splits the storage space of `bytes32` exactly in half, with the real number part assigned to the least significant 16 bytes and the imaginary number part assigned to the most significant 16 bytes. This allows for compact storage without the need for structures and facilitates easy library implementations. The proposal supports cartesian, polar, and exponential formats, with example code given for the cartesian representation. The proposal does not address manipulation of complex numbers or the number of decimal places, leaving those topics for other EIP discussions. The proposal has no impact on other uses of the `bytes32` datatype and can be implemented with the Using Complex for bytes32 syntax. The proposal is aimed at improving code legibility and reducing storage costs for complex numbers in the Ethereum ecosystem.
