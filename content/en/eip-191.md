## Summary

ERC-191 proposes a specification for handling signed data in Ethereum contracts. The motivation behind this proposal is to address the issue of presigned transactions not being tied to a specific validator, which can lead to security vulnerabilities. The proposed format for signed data includes an initial 0x19 byte to ensure that it is not a valid RLP, and for a single byte whose value is in the [0x00, 0x7f] range, that byte is its own RLP encoding. This means that any signed data cannot be one RLP-structure, but a 1-byte RLP payload followed by something else. Additionally, 0x19 has been chosen because it is prepended before hashing in personal_sign, making it possible to extend the scheme by defining a version 0x45 (E) to handle these kinds of signatures. The proposal also includes a registry of version bytes, including 0x00 for the initial version, 0x01 for data with intended validator, and 0x45 for personal_sign messages. Overall, ERC-191 aims to provide a standardized approach for handling signed data in Ethereum contracts to improve security and prevent potential vulnerabilities.
