ERC-1080 is a standard interface for tokens on the Ethereum blockchain that allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens extending ERC-20 or ERC-791. This standard provides basic functionality to recover stolen or lost accounts, as well as provide for the chargeback of tokens. The RecoverableToken method includes claimLost, cancelLostClaim, and reportStolen, which trigger events and freeze tokens in the event of theft or loss. The purpose of this standard is to mitigate the effects of reasonably provable token or asset loss or theft and to help resolve other conflicts without modifying Ethereum's protocol. The ERC-1080 standard aims to provide a standardized format for fund recovery EIPs and an objective standard by which to measure future proposals. Each ethereum recovery proposal (ERP) will reference this EIP and follow the guidelines set out here. The purpose of each ERP is to clearly describe the issue to be corrected, describe why an irregular state change is both necessary and justified, and demonstrate that the proposed actions will achieve the ERP's objectives. Each ERP will be required to use a standard format to represent the set of proposed state changes and must include a verification script that can reliably generate those changes.
