EIP-1898 proposes adding a `blockHash` option to JSON-RPC methods that currently support the defaultBlock parameter in Ethereum. This would allow clients to unambiguously specify the block they want to query for certain JSON-RPC methods, even if the block is not in the canonical chain. The proposal suggests adding an OBJECT option to the defaultBlock parameter, which includes a block number and a block hash. If the block is not found, the callee should raise a JSON-RPC error. The proposal simplifies previous ideas proposed in EIP-98 and EIP-210 by removing needless complexity and writing the EIP in EVM code. The proposal is not intended to be permanent and when eth1 is merged into eth2, the BLOCKHASH opcode would likely be repurposed to use eth2âs built-in history accumulator structure.
