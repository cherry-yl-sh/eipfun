EIP-1418 proposes a mechanism for paying rent for storage on the Ethereum blockchain. The rent is priced in Ether and is not negotiated by clients, nor is it dynamic. The proposal recommends implementation variables per account, including a block number for when rent was last paid and a block number for when the account will be evicted if rent is not paid. Clients may choose to delete storage from disk for every evicted account, but a future EIP may incentivize keeping this data for a fee. The proposal acknowledges that many smart contracts allow arbitrary amounts of storage, which could limit the usefulness of the proposal on an existing chain. The proposal also suggests a future EIP to create a mechanism for clients to exchange information about storage states. A future EIP may also change the pricing to be dynamic, using notarization and feedback mechanisms to set a market price for storage. EIP-1559 already introduces a mechanism for nodes to participate without recording the full network state and for clients to warm cache with storage data in their type 2 transactions. The proposal notes that users will need to be educated about the new rent payment mechanism.
