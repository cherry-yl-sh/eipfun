## Summary

The ERC-5539 proposal suggests a role-based registry of indicators for revocations that can be used in both centralized and decentralized credential attestation. The proposal aims to provide a standardized interface for managing and resolving revocation states in a contract registry. The proposal addresses the centralized aspect of traditional revocation lists, which rely on HTTP servers and caching, making them vulnerable to known attack vectors in the traditional web space. The proposal suggests that issuers should be able to focus on their area of expertise, including ownership of their revocable material, instead of worrying about infrastructure. The proposal lays the groundwork for anyone to own the lifecycle of verifiable information to build trust in ecosystems. The proposal includes specifications for revocation management, revocation list management, owner management, delegation management, events, and meta transactions. The proposal also addresses security considerations, including meta transactions and rights management.
