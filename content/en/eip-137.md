## Summary

The ERC-137 proposal, also known as the Ethereum Domain Name Service (ENS) specification, is a standard for creating a decentralized domain name system on the Ethereum blockchain. The purpose of this proposal is to provide a way for users to register human-readable domain names, such as "myname.eth," that can be used to identify and interact with smart contracts and other Ethereum-based services. The ENS system is designed to be secure, scalable, and easy to use, with features such as name auctions, automatic renewal, and integration with existing DNS systems. The proposal includes technical specifications for how the ENS system should be implemented, including the use of smart contracts and the Ethereum Name Service Registry. Overall, the ERC-137 proposal aims to make it easier for users to interact with the Ethereum ecosystem by providing a more user-friendly and accessible way to access smart contracts and other services.
