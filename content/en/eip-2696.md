EIP-2696 is a standard for remote procedure calls between an Ethereum Provider and an Ethereum Client when both are able to interface with each other via a shared JavaScript object. It provides the description of an object that is made available to JavaScript applications which they can use to communicate with the Ethereum blockchain through. This standard only describes the transport mechanism, it does not specify the payloads that are valid nor does it specify how the client or the provider will discover or agree on payload content.
