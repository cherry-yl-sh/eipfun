ERC-1761 is a standard interface for token contracts that have an "ID" domain, such as ERC-1155 or ERC-721. It enables restricted approval of one or more Token IDs to a specific "scope". This means that implementors can define scopes as needed, and users can approve the entire low-value token scope to a third-party smart contract, exchange, or other application without concern about losing their high-value tokens in the event of a problem. The motivation behind this interface is to prevent losses in cases where users do not audit the contracts they're approving. No standard API is supplied to manage scopes as this is implementation specific. Some implementations may opt to offer a fixed number of scopes, or assign a specific set of scopes to certain types. Other implementations may open up scope configuration to its users and offer methods to create scopes and assign IDs to them. Overall, ERC-1761 provides a way to limit approvals to specific domains and is a generalization of the idea of managing tokens from multiple different domains.
