The ERC-5437 proposal suggests a standardized way for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain to include contact information for security concerns. This includes an email address and/or public key for secure communication. The proposal also recommends that this information be kept up-to-date and that encryption keys be rotated regularly. The goal of this proposal is to improve security practices for smart contracts and make it easier for individuals to report security concerns to the appropriate parties. It is recommended that new versions of smart contracts adopt this proposal in addition to any legacy approaches.
