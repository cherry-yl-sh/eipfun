EIP-4345 proposes to delay the Ethereum network's difficulty bomb until June 2022. The difficulty bomb is a mechanism that increases the difficulty of mining Ethereum over time, making it more challenging to mine new blocks. This is intended to encourage the transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake consensus, which is more energy-efficient. However, if left unchecked, the difficulty bomb can make mining nearly impossible, which would grind the network to a halt. 

The proposed delay would give developers more time to implement the necessary changes for the transition to proof-of-stake. It would also prevent the network from becoming unusable in the meantime. The delay would be achieved by adjusting the block timestamp, which would slow down the increase in mining difficulty. 

EIP-4345 is consensus-compatible, meaning it would not cause a hard fork in the Ethereum network. It is also backward-compatible, meaning that nodes running older versions of the software would still be able to participate in the network. 

Overall, EIP-4345 is a necessary step to ensure the smooth transition of the Ethereum network to proof-of-stake. By delaying the difficulty bomb, developers have more time to implement the necessary changes, and users can continue to use the network without interruption.
