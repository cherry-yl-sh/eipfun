## Summary

The EIP-1015 proposal suggests changing the block reward system by allowing an on-chain contract to decide where the rewards go, with hard limits on how they are issued. This proposal relates to configurable on-chain issuance by proposing a dynamic system for block rewards instead of hard coding them in the protocol.
