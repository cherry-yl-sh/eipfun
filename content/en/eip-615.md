## Summary

The EIP-615 proposal introduces subroutines and static jumps for the EVM, addressing the issue of dynamic jumps which make EVM code difficult to statically analyze and hinder critical tools for preventing expensive bugs. The proposal aims to tighten EVM security guarantees and reduce barriers to performance by allowing for near-linear time validation, bytecode compilation to machine code in near-linear time, and more effective optimization of gas metering and use of smaller registers. The proposal also proposes a versioning scheme to allow for its bytecode to be deployed with existing bytecode on the same blockchain.
