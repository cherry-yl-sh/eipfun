The EIP-712 proposal is a standard for hashing and signing of typed structured data as opposed to just bytestrings. It includes a theoretical framework for correctness of encoding functions, specification of structured data similar to and compatible with Solidity structs, safe hashing algorithm for instances of those structures, safe inclusion of those instances in the set of signable messages, an extensible mechanism for domain separation, new RPC call eth_signTypedData, and an optimized implementation of the hashing algorithm in EVM.
