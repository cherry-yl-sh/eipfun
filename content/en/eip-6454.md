The ERC-6454 proposal introduces a minimal extension to the ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token (NFT) standard, allowing for the identification of whether an NFT can be transferred or not. This provides new possibilities for NFT utility and evolution, while also maintaining compatibility with existing use cases. The proposal inherits the transfer and approval logic from ERC-721, as well as the metadata standards for name, symbol, and metadata URI lookup. The objective of the proposal is to create a universally transferable NFT representation of physical real estate, while also ensuring that the state of the on-chain property NFT accurately mirrors its physical counterpart. This is achieved by having a trusted party, such as an Administrator, issue a legally-binding digital representation of the physical property, eliminating the need for a change in legal ownership each time the NFT changes hands. Overall, the ERC-6454 proposal aims to provide a minimal yet powerful extension to the ERC-721 NFT standard, enabling new possibilities for NFT utility and interoperability.
