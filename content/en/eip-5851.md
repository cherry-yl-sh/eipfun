The ERC-5851 proposal introduces a method of certifying that a particular address meets a claim and verifying those certifications using on-chain metadata. Claims are assertions or statements made about a subject having certain properties that may be met conditions, and are certified by issuers using a Soundbound Token (SBT). The proposal aims to provide on-chain commitment of the off-chain verification process for decentralized identity (DID) issuers and verifier entities to create smart contracts. Once the given address is associated with the given attestation of the identity verification off-chain, the issuers can then onboard other verifiers to define the condition of the ownership of the user in order to reduce the technical barriers and overhead of current implementations. The proposal is motivated by the need for on-chain issuance of verifiable attestations to avoid Sybil attacks with one person one vote, participation in certain events with credentials, and compliance with government financial regulations, among others. The proposal also includes definitions, metadata standards, interface specifications, rationale, backwards compatibility, test cases, reference implementation, security considerations, and copyright information.
