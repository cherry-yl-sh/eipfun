ERC-5334 proposes an extension to the EIP-721 standard that adds an additional role called "user" which can be granted to addresses, along with a time limit for the role (expires) and a level. The user role represents permission to "use" the NFT, but not the ability to transfer it or set users. This is useful for NFTs with certain utilities, where the owner and user may not always be the same. The proposal aims to provide a unified standard for managing permissions to perform actions accordingly. The proposal includes a contract interface, rationale, and security considerations. Backward compatibility issues were not found. ERC-20 and ERC-1155 are unsupported as partial ownership is much more complex to track than boolean ownership. The proposal is available for citation and copyright and related rights are waived via CC0.
