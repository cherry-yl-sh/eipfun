EIP-5022 proposes increasing the gas cost of the SSTORE opcode from 20,000 to 40,000 when the original slot is zero and the resultant slot is non-zero. The motivation behind this proposal is to address the issue of state growth, which is one of the main reasons for not increasing the gas limit. Currently, the cost of creating new storage slots has not increased, which means that all users of other opcodes are subsidizing the creation of state. By increasing the price of state growth, developers will be incentivized to reuse storage instead. The proposal also suggests that increasing the gas refund from setting non-zero to zero requires further discussion. While solutions like state rent or state expiry have been researched, they will not be ready in the short to medium term, so it is desirable to patch pricing for the short term. The specific amount of 40,000 gas was chosen because the current pricing was based on a naive approach of benchmarking opcodes on a laptop, and did not consider the long-term problem of having the same price for a resource that costs more over time. The proposal acknowledges that this change will severely impact the gas cost of many applications, but argues that the network should not subsidize state growth at the expense of more expensive regular transactions. The proposal includes a new gas schedule that applies for blocks where block.number >= FORK_BLOCK, and notes that contracts that depend on hardcoded gas costs will break if they create state.
