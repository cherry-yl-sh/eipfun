ERC-5485 is a proposed standard for smart contracts to declare their legitimacy lineage, jurisdiction they observe, and sovereignty if they choose to not fall onto any jurisdiction. This standard aims to support better integration with today's legal and regulative scenarios by allowing a regulative body to allow or deny interoperability with smart contracts. It also allows DAOs to declare "self-sovereignty" by announcing via this interface that they do not assert legitimacy from any source other than themselves. The interface supports both cases, providing a way to allow smart contracts to determine if they want to allow/prohibit interaction based on sovereignty. For example, a country might want to require any digital money service's all smart contracts to observe their ERC-5485 jurisdiction before they are allowed to operate money in their (real world) legal jurisdiction. Overall, ERC-5485 provides a way for compliant smart contracts to identify their legitimacy, jurisdiction, and sovereignty relationship, which can help with regulatory compliance and interoperability.
