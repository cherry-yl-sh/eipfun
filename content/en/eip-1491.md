ERC-1491 proposes a standard interface for Human Capital Accounting tokens within smart contracts. This standard allows for the discovery, tracking, and transfer of the motivational hierarchy of human resources. The goal is to reduce market search costs and increase the autonomous insertion of mindful innovation into the blockchain ecosystem. The standard also discusses the Belief-Desire-Intention model and how it can be used in agent-based modeling systems. The proposal suggests that the blockchain's cryptographic security architecture can reliably scale to a blockchain-based PKI web-of-trust hierarchies. The ERC-20 token standard allows any tokens on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications, while the ERC-721 token standard allows wallet/broker/auction applications to work with any NFT on Ethereum. Finally, the ERC-1155 Crypto Item standard allows a smart contract interface where one can represent any number of ERC-20 and ERC-721 assets in a single contract.
