## Summary

ERC-5095 is a proposed standard for principal tokens, which are zero-coupon tokens that can be redeemed for a single underlying EIP-20 token at a future timestamp. The lack of standardization for principal tokens has led to difficulties in development and integration, as developers are currently expected to implement individual adapters for each principal token, as well as adapters for their pool and custodial contracts. 

The ERC-5095 standard is an extension of the EIP-20 token and provides basic functionality for depositing and withdrawing tokens, reading balances, and EIP-712 signature-based approvals. All principal tokens must implement EIP-20's optional metadata extensions, and if a principal token is non-transferrable, it may revert on calls to EIP-20 operations. The name and symbol functions of principal tokens should reflect the underlying token's name and symbol, as well as the origination protocol and, in the case of yield tokenization protocols, the origination money-market. 

Overall, ERC-5095 aims to provide a standardized approach to principal tokens, making it easier for developers to integrate them into applications and wallets, and ultimately promoting growth in the space.
