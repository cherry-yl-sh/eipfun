EIP-5792, titled "Wallet Function Call API," proposes a new API for Ethereum wallets to allow dApps to make multiple function calls in a single transaction. This proposal aims to improve the user experience by reducing the number of confirmations required and enabling more complex interactions with contracts.

The proposal introduces two new RPC methods: wallet_sendFunctionCallBundle and wallet_getBundleStatus. The wallet_sendFunctionCallBundle method allows dApps to send a bundle of function calls from the user's wallet. The wallet_getBundleStatus method returns the status of a bundle that was sent via wallet_sendFunctionCallBundle.

The document also introduces a new RPC method, wallet_showBundleStatus, which requests the wallet to show the status of a given bundle. This allows dApps to delegate the display of the function call status to the wallet, which can most accurately render the current status of the bundle.

The rationale behind this proposal is to enhance the user experience by reducing the number of confirmations required and enabling more complex interactions with contracts. The document mentions that there are no known backward compatibility issues associated with this proposal. The test cases, reference implementation, and security considerations are yet to be determined.
