ERC-2678 proposes a data format for package manifest documents that represent a package of one or more smart contracts, including source code and any/all deployed instances across multiple networks. The package manifests are minified JSON objects to be distributed via content addressable storage networks, such as IPFS, and published to on-chain EthPM registries. The proposal aims to encourage the Ethereum development ecosystem towards software best practices around code reuse by providing a general-purpose solution that has been designed with observed common practices in mind. The proposal updates the schema for a package manifest to be compatible with the metadata output for compilers.
