The ERC-4527 proposal suggests a QR code data transmission protocol between offline signers and watch-only wallets. Currently, there are four possible data transmission methods between offline signers and watch-only wallets: QR Code, USB, Bluetooth, and file transfer. The proposal argues that QR code transmission has advantages over the other three methods, including transparency and security. The proposal moves away from the JSON format used in the alpha version of the WalletConnect protocol and uses a URI instead of JSON inside the QR code. The proposal also requires versioning as part of the syntax for this URI specification to allow the WalletConnect protocol to evolve and allow backward compatibility whenever a new version is introduced. The proposal emphasizes that URIs should be shared between user devices or applications, and no sensitive data is shared within the URI that could compromise the communication or would allow control of the userâ€™s private keys. The proposal is currently in the process of being peer-reviewed, and interested parties can participate in the discussion using the provided link.
