EIP-1702 proposes a method of hard forking while maintaining the exact functionality of existing accounts by allowing multiple versions of virtual machines to execute in the same block. This is useful for upgrading the VM or introducing new VMs, and for defining future account state structures when introducing the on-chain WebAssembly virtual machine. The account state is RLP-encoded with 4 items when the version is zero, and with 5 items when the version is not zero. Account versions can also define additional account state RLP fields, whose meaning is specified through its version field. This allows breaking features to be implemented while making sure existing contracts work as expected. The scheme can also be helpful when deploying on-chain WebAssembly virtual machine, as WASM contracts and EVM contracts can co-exist and the execution boundary and interaction model are clearly defined. Test cases and implementations are to be added.
