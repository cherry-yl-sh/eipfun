EIP-3561 proposes a trust-minimized upgradeability proxy for anonymous developers who struggle to earn the trust of the community. The specification is an addition to the standard EIP-1967 transparent proxy design and focuses on the slots it adds. The proxy includes additional storage slots for upgradeability, which are assumed to decrease trust in interaction with upgradeable smart contracts. The desirable implementation logic address must be first defined as next logic before it can function as actual logic implementation stored in EIP-1967 IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT. Admin interactions with the next logic contract address correspond with specific methods and events. The EIP introduces a time delay before an actual upgrade to prevent abuse, even though it may be inconvenient for inexperienced developers. Users must ensure that a trust-minimized proxy they interact with does not allow overflows, represents the exact copy of the code in implementation, and ensure that the Zero Trust Period length is reasonable. Overall, the EIP aims to provide a critically important option to have in smart contract development today.
