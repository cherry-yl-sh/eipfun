EIP-1283 proposes a change to how gas is charged for EVM SSTORE operations in order to reduce excessive gas costs in situations where they are unwarranted and to enable new use-cases for contract storage. Currently, SSTORE operations are charged 20,000 gas to set a slot from 0 to non-0, 5,000 gas for any other change, and a 10,000 gas refund when a slot is set from non-0 to 0. This results in excessive gas costs for sequences of operations that make multiple updates. EIP-1283 proposes net gas metering changes for SSTORE opcode, enabling new usages for contract storage, and reducing excessive gas costs where it doesn't match how most implementation works. This acts as an alternative for EIP-1087, where it tries to be friendlier to implementations that use different optimization strategies for storage change caches. The proposal suggests using information that is more universally available to most implementations and requires as little change in implementation structures as possible. The new gas cost calculation logic replaces SSTORE opcode gas cost calculation (including refunds) with the following logic: if the current value equals the new value (this is a no-op), 200 gas is deducted. If the current value does not equal the new value, the gas cost is calculated based on the original value, current value, and new value. This proposal benefits subsequent storage write operations within the same call frame, exchange storage information between sub call frame and parent call frame, and more.
