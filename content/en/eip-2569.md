ERC-2569 proposes a set of interfaces to save and retrieve SVG images in Ethereum for universal tokens, including fungible tokens, non-fungible tokens, and tokens based on future standards. The proposal includes two interfaces, one for saving an SVG file in Ethereum and the other for retrieving an SVG file from Ethereum. The motivation for this proposal is to address the issue of images attached to tokens not being saved permanently and tamper-resistantly in Ethereum. The proposal suggests using SVG images due to their compact file size and scalability. The proposal outlines typical applications for this interface set, including storage of a token's icon or logo, such as for a DAO's reputation token. The proposal also includes steps for retrieving an SVG image from Ethereum for tokens with or without an ID member variable. Overall, ERC-2569 aims to provide a solution for permanent and tamper-resistant storage of images in Ethereum for universal tokens.
