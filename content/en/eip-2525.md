The ERC-2525 proposal suggests a method to improve the universal method of login to the Ethereum blockchain by leveraging the metadata storage provided by the ENS. The proposal considers a user to be logged in when there is an EIP-1193 provider that can sign transactions and messages on their behalf. The approach is inspired by Alex Van de Sande's work and Web3Connect and should be extended to work with any blockchain in the future. The proposal aims to make the login process more seamless for non-crypto-aware users and reduce the integration effort required from Dapp developers. ENSLogin should be mostly transparent for users, and most wallet providers will set up the necessary entries without requiring any effort from the user. Advanced users can take control over the wallet resolution process, which will be simple once the right tooling is available. The proposal also includes a table showing the support for ENSLogin by various wallet providers. The proposal acknowledges that while ENSLogin allows Dapps to support any wallet for logging in, Dapps still must choose which wallets they suggest to users for registration. The proposal suggests using a component like Web3Connect or BlockNative's to make this process easier. The proposal also includes a section on possible evolutions, such as multichain support, and an FAQ section.
