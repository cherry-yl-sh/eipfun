EIP-1051 proposes the addition of overflow checking for arithmetic operations in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Currently, manual checks are required for every arithmetic operation to prevent overflow, which can be inefficient and insecure. The proposal suggests adding two new flags to the EVM state: overflow (ovf) and signed overflow (sovf). The ovf flag would be set when an ADD, SUB, or MUL opcode produces an output that exceeds 2^256 - 1 or is less than 0. The sovf flag would be set whenever the ovf flag is set, as well as in specific circumstances such as when an ADD or SUB opcode results in a different most significant bit (MSB) or when a MUL opcode with both inputs being positive has a negative output. The proposal aims to facilitate efficient and secure contracts by allowing for periodic overflow checks rather than manual checks after every operation.
