The ERC-223 proposal introduces a communication model for contracts that interact with fungible tokens. It informs receiving contracts of tokens and is more gas-efficient when depositing tokens to contracts. It also allows for data recording for financial transfers and introduces the ability to correct user errors. The proposal requires contracts intending to receive these tokens to implement tokenReceived and token transfers to contracts not implementing tokenReceived to revert. The interface of this token is similar to that of ERC-20, but the transfer function is not backwards compatible with ERC-20.
