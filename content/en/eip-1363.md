The ERC-1363 proposal defines a token interface for ERC-20 tokens that allows executing recipient or spender code after a transfer or approval in a single transaction. This makes token payments easier and eliminates the need for sending another transaction and paying GAS twice. The proposal is inspired by the ERC-721 onERC721Received and ERC721TokenReceiver behaviours and is useful for creating token payable crowdsales, selling services for tokens, paying invoices, making subscriptions, or any other purposes that require the execution of a callback after a transfer or approval received. Implementing contracts must implement the ERC-1363 interface as well as the ERC-20 and ERC-165 interfaces. To ensure that the amount transacted is the same as the amount intended, the amount communicated to the human user should be easily verifiable by inspection, including the order of magnitude. The proposal recommends using scientific notation with an exponent corresponding to the nominal unit of the transacted token (e.g. 18 in case of ether) to facilitate human inspection of the amount. The proposal is named "Payable Token" and is useful for Ethereum smart contracts that can accept ERC-20 payments.
