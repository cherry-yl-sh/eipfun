ERC-6315 proposes a variant of ERC-2771 that does not require trusted forwarders for meta-transactions. It extends ERC-2771 to provide support for trustless account abstraction. The proposal includes a forwarder interface and specifies that when a function of a recipient is called, the recipient must staticcall the isForwardedTransaction() function of the caller. If this returns true, the transaction must be considered a forwarded transaction with the sender being extracted using the same procedure that ERC-2771 uses to extract the "Transaction Signer", and the forwarder set to the caller. The proposal also includes extensions for modular smart contract accounts and minimal multi-token interface.
