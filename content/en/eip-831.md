## Summary

ERC-831 is a standard for creating Ethereum URIs, which are used for cross-application signaling between loosely coupled applications. These URIs can be embedded in QR codes, hyperlinks, emails, or chat messages, and allow for instant invocation of the user's preferred wallet application. The URI format contains "ethereum" or "eth" in the schema (protocol) part and is constructed with an optional prefix and mandatory payload. The prefix defines the use-case for the URI, and if no prefix is given, "pay-" is assumed for backward compatibility with EIP-67. The payload's content depends on the prefix and is defined in the ERC for the specific use-case. 

The need for ERC-831 arose when refining EIP-681, which is a standard for URL format for transaction requests. ERC-831 aims to keep backward compatibility with EIP-67 and not break existing things. The open prefix approach was chosen to adopt future use-cases and not block the whole "ethereum:" scheme for a limited set of use-cases that existed at the time of writing. 

To ensure that the amount transacted is the same as the amount intended, the amount communicated to the human user should be easily verifiable by inspection, including the order of magnitude. In case of ERC-20 token payments, the interface should display the amount in the units specified in the token contract. Otherwise, it should be displayed as expressed in the URL, possibly alerting the user to the uncertainty of the nominal unit. The use of scientific notation with an exponent corresponding to the nominal unit of the transacted token is advisable to facilitate human inspection of the amount. 

In summary, ERC-831 is a standard for creating Ethereum URIs that allow for cross-application signaling between loosely coupled applications. It aims to keep backward compatibility with EIP-67 and adopt future use-cases with an open prefix approach. The standard also provides guidelines for displaying the amount transacted to ensure that it is the same as the amount intended.
