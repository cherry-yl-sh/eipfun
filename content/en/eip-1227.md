The EIP-1227 proposal aims to permanently disable the "difficulty bomb" and reset the block reward to pre-Byzantium levels in Ethereum. This is to address the issue of an artificial exponential increase in difficulty until chain freeze, which makes it challenging for users to remain on the unforked chain after a hard-fork, especially when a controversial change is included. The proposal suggests adjusting block rewards to a base of 5 ETH, and uncle and nephew rewards will be adjusted accordingly.
