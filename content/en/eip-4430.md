ERC-4430 proposes a method for contracts to provide a human-readable description of a transaction's side-effects. This is intended to improve the user experience when using Ethereum wallets, as users often have to approve transactions without fully understanding their effects. The proposal suggests using a contract method to generate both a human-readable description and machine-readable bytecode simultaneously. This allows users to agree to the human-readable component in a UI while the machine executes the bytecode once accepted. The proposal acknowledges that it does not address malicious contracts that may lie in their descriptions, but suggests that auditors and code reviewers can check transaction descriptions for accuracy during their review.
