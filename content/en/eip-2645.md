## Summary

ERC-2645 is a proposal for a hierarchical deterministic wallet for layer-2 solutions, specifically in the context of Computation Integrity Proof (CIP) Layer-2 solutions such as ZK-Rollups. The proposal leverages existing work on key derivation, such as BIP32, BIP39, and BIP44, to define an efficient and secure way to produce private keys for CIP L2s, while also creating domain separation between Layer-2 applications. The proposal defines a derivation path for Starkware keys, which is BIP43-compatible and inspired by BIP44. The purpose of this proposal is to maintain the same standard and security in the new space of Layer-2 solutions as in the entire industry of wallets, independent of the underlying blockchain. The proposal is related to the discussion on derivation paths in Ethereum, as it introduces another derivation path that requires existing software to add support for this scheme in addition to any existing schemes. However, the authors anticipate that this will cause relatively little additional disruption, and has the potential to improve matters significantly in the long run.
