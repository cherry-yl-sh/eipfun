EIP-161 is a proposal for improving the security of the Ethereum network by reducing the risk of replay attacks. A replay attack is when a transaction that was intended for one network is copied and broadcasted on another network, resulting in unintended consequences. This can happen when two networks share the same transaction format, such as Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. 

The proposal suggests implementing a new opcode, "REVERT", which would allow contracts to return all remaining gas to the sender and revert any state changes made during the transaction. This would make it easier for users to avoid replay attacks by allowing them to include a "revert" instruction in their transactions. 

The proposal also suggests changing the way contract addresses are generated to make them more resistant to replay attacks. Currently, contract addresses are generated using the sender's address and a nonce. The proposal suggests using a hash of the sender's address, the nonce, and the contract code instead. 

Overall, the goal of EIP-161 is to improve the security of the Ethereum network by reducing the risk of replay attacks. By implementing a new opcode and changing the way contract addresses are generated, the proposal aims to make it easier for users to protect themselves from unintended consequences caused by replay attacks. 

In summary, EIP-161 is a proposal for improving the security of the Ethereum network by reducing the risk of replay attacks. It suggests implementing a new opcode and changing the way contract addresses are generated to make it easier for users to protect themselves from unintended consequences caused by replay attacks.
