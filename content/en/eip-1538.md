ERC-1538 is a standard for creating upgradeable and transparent contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows for the addition, replacement, and removal of multiple functions of a contract at the same time, and provides standard events to show these changes. The standard also includes a way to query a contract to retrieve information about all functions exposed by it. This solves the 24KB maximum contract size limitation and makes the maximum contract size of a transparent contract practically unlimited. Additionally, the standard allows for an upgradeable contract to become immutable in the future if desired. The motivation behind this standard is to provide a way to create trustless contracts that can still be changed in case of bugs or other issues.
