The ERC-918 is a standardized Mineable Token specification that uses a Proof of Work algorithm for distribution. It describes a method for initially locking tokens within a token contract and slowly dispensing them with a mint() function which uses a Proof of Work algorithm to minimize gas fees and control the distribution rate. The standardization of mineable tokens is intended to give rise to standardized CPU and GPU token mining software, token mining pools, and other external tools in the token mining ecosystem. The motivation behind this standard is to distribute tokens via an ‘Initial Mining Offering’ (IMO) to diminish investor risk exposure and reduce centralization in new token projects. The ERC-918 is intended to be standalone, allowing maximum interoperability with other token standards such as ERC20 and ERC721.
