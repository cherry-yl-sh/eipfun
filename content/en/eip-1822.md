The ERC-1822 is a standard for proxy contracts that allows for unlimited upgrades without creating incompatibility between the proxy and business-logic contracts. It achieves this by utilizing a unique storage position in the proxy contract to store the Logic Contractâs address and performing a compatibility check to ensure successful upgrades. The standard also provides a method for selecting from multiple constructors without inhibiting the ability to verify bytecode. The motivation behind this standard is to improve upon existing proxy implementations and improve the developer experience for deploying and maintaining Proxy and Logic Contracts. The standard also aims to standardize and improve the methods for verifying the bytecode used by the Proxy Contract. The terminology used in this standard includes delegatecall(), Proxy Contract, and Logic Contract. The standard acknowledges that a proxy without a time delay before an actual upgrade is abusable and recommends a reasonable Zero Trust Period length of at least two weeks if upgrades are usually being revealed beforehand, and in most cases at least a month. Overall, the ERC-1822 standard provides a secure and trust-minimized way to upgrade smart contracts without creating incompatibility issues.
