EIP-6475, titled "SSZ Optional," introduces a new Simple Serialize (SSZ) type to represent Optional[T] values. Currently, optional values can only be represented in SSZ using workarounds. This proposal aims to improve readability and compact serialization.rnrnThe proposal introduces a new type definition, Optional[T], which can represent a value of SSZ type T or the absence of a value, indicated by None. The default value of Optional[T] is None. The serialization and deserialization of an Optional[T] depend on whether the value is None or not. If the value is None, the list length is 0 during Merkleization. Otherwise, the list length is 1, and the first list element contains the underlying value.rnrnThe document also discusses the rationale behind not using Union[None, T] and List[T, 1] as alternatives. Union[None, T] leaves ambiguity about the intention whether the type may be extended in the future, i.e., Union[None, T, U]. The serialization of List[T, 1] is less compact for variable-length T due to the extra offset table at the beginning of the list to indicate the list length.rnrnThe document mentions that there are no known backward compatibility issues or security considerations associated with this proposal. The test cases and reference implementation are yet to be determined.
