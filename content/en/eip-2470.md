The ERC-2470 proposes the creation of a CREATE2 factory that allows for the deployment of keyless deterministic contracts with the same address on any chain. This is useful for contracts that are designed to be Singletons and should exist as one instance for all, such as EIP-1820 and EIP-2429. The factory uses Nick's method to deploy contracts on any chain and have a deterministic address. The standard provides the code for the Singleton Factory smart contract, which exposes CREATE2 to deploy bytecode on deterministic addresses based on initialization code and salt. The motivation behind this standard is code reuse and making it easier to deploy singletons. The specification includes the deployment transaction, deployment method, single-use factory deployment account, factory contract address, and ABI for SingletonFactory. The standard also includes rationale, backwards compatibility, test cases, implementation, security considerations, and copyright information. Overall, the ERC-2470 aims to provide a permissionless factory for the deployment of keyless deterministic contracts with the same address on any chain, making it easier for projects requiring this feature to use the factory in any chain with the same setup, even in development chains.
