The ERC-5058 proposal suggests extending the EIP-721 standard with a secure locking mechanism for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This would allow NFT owners to approve an operator to lock their NFTs, which would prevent them from being transferred until the end of the locking period. This would enable NFTs to participate in smart contracts without leaving the wallets of their owners, which would address issues related to smart contract risks, loss of utility, and missing airdrops. The proposed standard would support common NFTFi use cases including locking, staking, lending, and crowdfunding, and would encourage NFT owners to participate more actively in NFTFi projects. The proposal includes a specification for the Lockable EIP-721 standard, which would implement the IERC5058 interfaces.
