EIP-7 proposes the addition of a new opcode, DELEGATECALL, to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This opcode is similar to CALLCODE but propagates the sender and value from the parent scope to the child scope. In other words, it allows a contract to delegate a call to another contract while maintaining the original sender and value. The DELEGATECALL opcode can be useful in various scenarios such as creating libraries that can be shared across multiple contracts or implementing complex contract interactions. It also helps reduce gas costs by avoiding unnecessary copying of data between contracts. The specification for DELEGATECALL includes details on gas costs, unused gas refunds, and limitations on depth limits. The activation block for this opcode was set at block 1,150,000 on the mainnet and block 494,000 on Morden. Overall, EIP-7 provides an important improvement to the Ethereum network by enabling more efficient and flexible contract interactions.
