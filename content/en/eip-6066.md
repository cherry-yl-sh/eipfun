ERC-6066 proposes a standard method for validating signatures made by Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) such as ERC-721 and ERC-1155. The motivation behind this proposal is to create a more tangible link between NFTs, digital art, owners, and artists. The proposal suggests that a concise standard for art will make it easier for artists to maintain a connection with the Ethereum blockchain and their fans who purchase their tokens. The proposal also aims to designate an original NFT and printed editions with signatures in a trustless manner. The proposal does not include a signature generation standard as it would restrict flexibility, but instead references Gnosis Safe's contract signing approach. The proposal is compatible with ERC-721 compliant contracts and is consistent with Gnosis Safe's contract signature implementation. The revokable nature of contract-based signatures should be taken into consideration by developers and users. Overall, ERC-6066 aims to provide a standard way for anyone to validate whether a signature made by an NFT is valid, which will aid the community in discovering alternative uses for NFTs beyond artwork.
