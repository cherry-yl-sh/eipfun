ERC-7015 is a proposed Ethereum Improvement Proposal that aims to solve the issue of creator attribution for ERC-721 Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) by allowing creators to sign the required parameters for NFT creation, including the NFT metadata and a hash of any other relevant information. The signed parameters and the signature are then validated and emitted during the deployment transaction, which allows the NFT to validate the creator and NFT platforms to attribute creatorship correctly.
