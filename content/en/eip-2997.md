## Summary

The EIP-2997 proposal suggests adding a new opcode, IMPERSONATECALL, to Ethereum which allows for the impersonation of a sender address during a transaction. This would enable native multi-user wallets and meta-transactions, as well as reduce deployment costs for non-custodial smart wallets. The opcode takes 7 operands and is similar to the CALL opcode, but with a different sender address derived from the real caller address and a salt.
