EIP-3584 proposes the implementation of a Block Access List in Ethereum, which is an extension of the existing access list concept. The Block Access List allows for witnesses to be included in a block's access list, which can be used to build a fingerprint for partial or full statelessness. The proposal also includes a signature that signs over the transaction type and data to prevent the transaction from being re-interpreted as a different type. 

The Block Access List is designed to maximize simplicity and avoid questions of duplication prevention. It does not lead to extra chain bloat in practice because gas is charged per item, and there is no gain in including a value in the access list twice. However, it does make applications that heavily rely on storage access less economically viable. 

Access list generation is difficult in real-time situations, but the proposal includes a 10% initial discount to access lists, making it almost costless to not bother with access list generation and only make a simple transaction. The cost of accessing state outside the access list is expected to be ramped up in future hard forks as access list generation becomes more mature. 

The Block Access List will increase the average block size, but the per-byte cost of access lists is much more expensive than calldata, making worst-case block size increase unlikely. Additionally, the ability to pre-fetch storage at the time of receiving a transaction and/or load storage in parallel upon receiving a block will partially compensate for the increase in average block size.
