The EIP-3198 proposal suggests implementing a BASEFEE opcode that starts with a base fee amount and adjusts it up and down based on network congestion. This allows wallets to auto-set gas fees for users in a reliable way, reducing the need for complex fee estimation algorithms and frequent fee overpayment. The base fee changes are constrained, making the maximum difference in base fee from block to block predictable. Additionally, the base fee is always burned, ensuring that only ETH can be used to pay for transactions and reducing risks associated with miner extractable value. This proposal aims to improve the efficiency of Ethereum's fee market by providing a more stable fee metric that is computed inside the protocol.
