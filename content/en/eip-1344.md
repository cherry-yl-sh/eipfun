EIP-1344 proposes the addition of a new opcode, ChainID, to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This opcode would allow smart contracts to access the unique identifier of the blockchain they are running on, known as the chain ID. Currently, there is no standard for how chain ID is set, which can lead to issues during contentious splits where multiple chains may have the same chain ID. The ChainID opcode would provide a simple way for developers to access the chain ID and handle potential updates to it. However, it is up to individual developers to decide if they need to implement additional mitigations, such as a trustless oracle, to handle updates to the chain ID. The proposal is fully backwards compatible with all chains that implement the EIP-155 chain ID domain separator for transaction signing.
