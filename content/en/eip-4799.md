The ERC-4799 proposal aims to create a standardized interface for designating ownership of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) held in escrow by a smart contract. This allows for the construction of a directed acyclic graph of NFTs, where the designated owner of every NFT in a given chain is the terminal address of that chain. This enables the introduction of additional functionality to pre-existing NFTs, without having to give up the authenticity of the original. The proposal addresses the limitations of current NFTs, which are limited by the fact that the only verifiable wallet associated with an NFT is the owner, so clients that want to distribute utility are forced to do so to an NFTâs listed owner. This means that any complex ownership agreements must be encoded into the original NFT contract - there is no mechanism by which an owner can link the authenticity of their original NFT to any external contract. The ERC-4799 proposal provides a simple ownership scheme that is backwards compatible, is light-weight and simple to implement, and can be widely adopted and depended on. The proposal can be (and has been) extended by other standards to add additional ownership functionality. The potential impact of this proposal on the Ethereum ecosystem is that it could enable the introduction of additional functionality to pre-existing NFTs, without having to give up the authenticity of the original, making NFTs more versatile and useful.
