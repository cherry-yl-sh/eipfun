The EIP-5003 proposal introduces a new opcode called AUTHUSURP, which allows code to be deployed at an EIP-3074 authorized address. This effectively revokes the original signing key's authority for externally owned accounts (EOAs). EOAs currently have limitations in terms of security and functionality, such as the inability to rotate keys or enable sponsored transactions. This proposal aims to provide a migration path off of EOAs by allowing code to be inserted in place of the original signing key. This would enable users to take advantage of the benefits of contract-based accounts, such as choosing their own authentication algorithm and enabling social recovery. However, contracts using ECDSA signatures outside of transactions may not be aware that the account is no longer controlled by a private key, which could pose a security risk. The proposal suggests mitigating this risk by modifying the ecrecover pre-compiled contract. The proposal is distinct from EIP-3074, which provides opcodes for delegating signing authority to a smart contract, while EIP-5003 provides a final migration path off the EOA's original signing key.
