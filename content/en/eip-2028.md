EIP-2028 proposes a reduction in gas cost for transaction data in Ethereum, which would increase the average data capacity but not the burst data capacity of the chain. This could lead to an increase in storage requirements for history-storing, with a worst-case scenario of up to 3.0 TB per year. To mitigate this risk, the proposal recommends implementing EIP-4444 or a similar history expiry proposal at the same time or soon after. The proposal also includes a flat penalty of 300 gas on top of the costs calculated in the table to account for the cost of loading the code.
