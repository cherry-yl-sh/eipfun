The ERC-2009 proposal suggests a service for decentralized compliance checks for regulated tokens on the Ethereum network. Its goal is to provide a way to comply with legal requirements such as KYC and AML without making the token transfer centralized or requiring a second confirmation step. The proposed Compliance Service supports more than one token and could be used by law-makers to maintain compliance rules of regulated tokens in one smart contract. It also provides a standard for compliance checks that third-party developers can use to verify if token movements for a specific account are allowed and act accordingly. The proposed solution is meant to be deployed as a Solidity smart contract on the Ethereum network and includes a checkTransferAllowed function.
