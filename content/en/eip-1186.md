EIP-1186 proposes a new RPC-Method called eth_getProof that allows for the creation of Merkle Proofs for accounts and storage values in Ethereum. Currently, the standard RPC-Interface does not provide access to these proofs, which are important for securing Layer2-Technologies. The proposed method returns three important data points: the four fields of an account-object, the MerkleProof for the account starting with a stateRoot from the specified block, and the MerkleProof for each requested storage entry starting with a storageHash from the account. This allows for offline verification of any account or storage-value, even for devices that cannot run a light client. The method also provides proofs for non-existent values, which is important for verifying the absence of data. The proposal suggests using the blockhash instead of the blocknumber to allow proofs of uncles-states and reducing data by only providing the accountProof and storageProof. The proposal is backwards compatible and tests still need to be implemented.
