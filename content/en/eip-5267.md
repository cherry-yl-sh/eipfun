## Summary

ERC-5267 is a proposal that complements EIP-712 by standardizing how contracts should publish the fields and values that describe their domain. This enables applications to retrieve this description and generate appropriate domain separators in a general way, and thus integrate EIP-712 signatures securely and scalably. The proposal defines an interface that can be used by applications to retrieve a definition of the domain that a contract uses to verify EIP-712 signatures.
