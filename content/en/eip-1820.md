ERC-1820 is a registry smart contract that provides a standardized way for smart contracts to discover and interact with other contracts and services on the Ethereum network. It is a simpler and fully decentralized alternative to previous attempts at pseudo-introspection, such as ERC-165 and ERC-672. nnOne of the key benefits of ERC-1820 is that it provides a unique address for all chains, solving the problem of resolving the correct registry address for different chains. This makes it easier for smart contracts to interact with each other across different chains. nnOverall, ERC-1820 is an important component of Ethereum's smart contract ecosystem as it helps to facilitate interoperability and standardization, making it easier for developers to build decentralized applications on the network.
