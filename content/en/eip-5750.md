## Summary

The ERC-5750 proposal aims to designate the last parameter of dynamically sized bytes to be used for behavior extensions of methods, in order to enable future extensibility and make methods more easily extendable. This standardization helps to address challenges such as determining method names and parameters, and achieving maximum backward and future compatibility. The proposal also provides examples of compliant and non-compliant methods, and considers security considerations and privacy concerns.
