The ERC-2304 proposal is a standard for multichain address resolution for ENS (Ethereum Name Service). It introduces new overloads for the addr field for ENS resolvers, which permit resolution of addresses for other blockchains via ENS. It specifies a new accessor function for resolvers that returns the cryptocurrency address for the specified namehash and coin type, and a new event for resolvers that is emitted on each change to the address for a name and coin type. The proposal aims to standardize a way to enter and retrieve addresses for non-Ethereum chains inside ENS in a cross-client fashion.
