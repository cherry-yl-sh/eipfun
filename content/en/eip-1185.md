ERC-1185 proposes a method for storing DNS records in the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) by using a modified version of the DNS TXT record format. This allows for general keys and values to be used, rather than defining specific record types for human-readable data such as URLs and emails. This approach allows for future extension without adjusting the resolver, while also allowing applications to use custom keys for their own purposes. The security of this solution is dependent on the security of the records within the ENS domain and the key(s) that have authority over that domain. The ERC also provides a citation for the document and waives copyright and related rights via CC0.
