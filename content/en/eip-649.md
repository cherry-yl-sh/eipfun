EIP-649 proposes to delay the difficulty bomb in Ethereum for approximately one and a half years and reduce the block rewards with the Byzantium fork, the first part of the Metropolis fork. The difficulty bomb, also known as the "ice age," is causing the average block times to increase, and delaying it will allow the Ethash proof-of-work to be feasible for miners and allow sealing new blocks every 15 seconds on average for another one and a half years. The block rewards will be adjusted to a base of 3 ETH, uncle and nephew rewards will be adjusted accordingly, and the use of block.number in the exponential ice age component will be replaced with a fake block number. The proposal aims to maintain stability of the system and decrease the likelihood of a miner-driven chain split as Ethereum approaches proof-of-stake.
