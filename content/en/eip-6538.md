## Summary

ERC-6538 is a draft proposal for a standardized way of storing and retrieving an entity's stealth meta-address on the Ethereum blockchain. The goal is to enhance privacy capabilities by enabling the recipient of a transfer to remain anonymous when receiving an asset. The proposal extends ERC-5564 and defines an ERC5564Registry that stores the stealth meta-address for entities, which can be identified by an address, ENS name, or other identifier. The contract is specified using a one byte integer to identify the stealth address scheme and maintain a mapping from the scheme ID to its specification. The proposal also includes an exact copy of the code of the ERC820 and ERC1820 registry smart contracts to provide a unique address for all chains and solve the problem of resolving the correct registry address for different chains. The standard is simpler than previous attempts at pseudo-introspection in Ethereum and is fully decentralized. However, it is important to note that this is a draft proposal and has not yet been implemented or adopted by the Ethereum community.
