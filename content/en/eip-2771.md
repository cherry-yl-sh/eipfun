The ERC-2771 proposal is a contract interface for receiving meta transactions through a trusted forwarder on the Ethereum blockchain. It defines a secure protocol for these transactions, which are authorized by a Transaction Signer and relayed by an untrusted third party that pays for the gas. The proposal includes definitions for Transaction Signer, Gas Relay, and Trusted Forwarder, and outlines a protocol support discovery mechanism. The proposal is designed to enable Ethereum contracts to accept calls from externally owned accounts that do not have ETH to pay for gas.
