ERC-6105 proposes a marketplace functionality to ERC-721 that enables non-fungible token trading without relying on an intermediary trading platform. This eliminates security concerns that arise from authorization via the setApprovalForAll function and allows creators to implement more diverse royalty schemes. To purchase an NFT using ERC-20 tokens, the buyer needs to first call the approve(address spender, uint256 amount) function of the ERC-20 token to grant the NFT contract access to a certain amount of tokens. Caution is advised when dealing with non-audited contracts.
