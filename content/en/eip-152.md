EIP-152 proposes adding a new precompiled contract to the Ethereum network that implements the compression function F used in the BLAKE2 cryptographic hashing algorithm. This would allow for easier interoperability between Ethereum and Zcash, as well as introducing more flexible cryptographic hash primitives to the EVM. BLAKE2 is a useful cryptographic hash function and SHA3 finalist that allows for efficient verification of the Equihash PoW used in Zcash, making a BTC Relay-style SPV client possible on Ethereum. However, a Solidity implementation of BLAKE2 would be prohibitively expensive for verifying Zcash block headers. The proposed precompile would enable the BLAKE2b hash function and other higher-round 64-bit BLAKE2 variants to run cheaply on the EVM, making interoperability with Zcash and other Equihash-based PoW coins possible. This could enable contracts like trustless atomic swaps between the chains, providing a much-needed aspect of privacy to the public Ethereum blockchain. The precompile would require 6 inputs tightly encoded, taking exactly 213 bytes, with the number of rounds specified as a 32-bit unsigned big-endian word.
