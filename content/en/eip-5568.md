ERC-5568 is a standard track proposal that introduces a machine-readable format to signal required actions to wallets by returning a custom revert code. This custom revert code contains just enough data to be extendable by future ERCs and to take in arbitrary parameters. It allows a smart contract to signal to a wallet that an action needs to be taken, such as to sign a transaction or send an HTTP request to a URL, simplifying the front-end code.
