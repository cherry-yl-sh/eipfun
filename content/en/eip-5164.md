## Summary

ERC-5164 defines a cross-chain execution interface for EVM-based blockchains, allowing contracts on one chain to call contracts on another by sending a cross-chain message. The specification includes two components: the Message Dispatcher and the Message Executor. The Message Dispatcher lives on the calling side, and the executor lives on the receiving side. When a message is sent, a Message Dispatcher will move the message through a transport layer to a Message Executor, where they are executed. Implementations of this specification must implement both components. The motivation for this specification is to coordinate state changes across multiple EVM-based blockchains, which often have different APIs for bridge integrations. Defining a common specification will increase code re-use and allow for the use of common bridge implementations. The specification allows contracts on one chain to send messages to contracts on another chain, and there are two key interfaces that need to be implemented. The specification uses key words such as "MUST", "SHOULD", and "OPTIONAL" to define requirements and recommendations for implementation.
