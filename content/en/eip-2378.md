EIP-2378, titled "EIPs Eligible for Inclusion," is part of an EIP-centric forking model. It tracks the first step in the approval process for any EIP to be included in a fork or upgrade. This stage is where the Core Developers vet the concept of an EIP and give a "green light" sufficient for EIP authors to move forward in development.rnrnThe pipeline for Core EIPs is as follows: [DRAFT] -> [ELIGIBLE FOR INCLUSION] -> [IMPLEMENTATION] -> [TESTING] -> [ACCEPTED]. This EIP documents all EIPs marked as Eligible For Inclusion by the All Core Devs. To reach this stage, an EIP must be discussed briefly on an AllCoreDevs Call and motioned by rough consensus to be moved to this stage.rnrnThe requirements for Eligibility for Inclusion are that the AllCoreDevs, representing the major clients and ecosystem stakeholders, are positive towards the EIP and would accept well-written PRs to include the EIP into the codebase, so that it could be toggled on for testing, but not with an actual block number for activation.rnrnThe EIP also lists several EIPs that have been marked as Eligible For Inclusion, including EIP-663, EIP-1057, EIP-1380, EIP-1559, EIP-1702, EIP-1962, EIP-1985, EIP-2046, EIP-2315, and EIP-2537.
