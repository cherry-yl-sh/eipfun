ERC-3475 proposes a new token standard that allows the creation of tokenized obligations with abstract on-chain metadata storage. It enables each bond class ID to represent a new configurable token type and corresponding to each class, corresponding bond nonces to represent an issuing condition or any other form of data in uint256. Bonds created by this EIP can also be batched for issuance/redemption conditions for efficiency on gas costs and UX side. This aims to improve the efficiency of storage usage in Ethereum by allowing for more complex reward and redemption logic to be stored on-chain in a gas-efficient manner.
