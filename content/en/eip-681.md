ERC-681 is a standard way of representing payment requests in ether and ERC-20 tokens as URLs. The specification provides a standardized URL format for payment requests, which allows for instant invocation of the user's preferred wallet application with the correct parameterization of the payment transaction. The convenience of representing payment requests by standard URLs has been a major factor in the wide adoption of Bitcoin, and bringing a similarly convenient mechanism to Ethereum would speed up its acceptance as a payment platform among end-users. Payment request URLs could be delivered through a very broad, ever-growing selection of channels, including QR codes, hyperlinks in web pages, emails, or chat messages. The syntax of payment request URLs contains "ethereum" in their schema (protocol) part and is constructed using a standard ABI type name and a URL-encoded unicode string of arbitrary length. The amount communicated to the human user should be easily verifiable by inspection, including the order of magnitude, and the use of scientific notation with an exponent corresponding to the nominal unit of the transacted token is advisable to facilitate human inspection of the amount. The specification supersedes the defunct ERC-67, which is a URL format for representing arbitrary transactions in a low-level fashion, and focuses specifically on the important special case of payment requests while allowing for other, ABI-specified transactions.
