## Summary

The ERC-181 proposal is an Ethereum Improvement Proposal that aims to provide support for reverse resolution of Ethereum addresses through the Ethereum Name Service (ENS). It is a simpler alternative to the ERC-672 proposal, which also uses reverse ENS but has some limitations and is not fully decentralized. The ERC-181 proposal provides a unique address for all chains, which solves the problem of resolving the correct registry address for different chains.

The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a proposed protocol and ABI definition that provides flexible resolution of short, human-readable names to service and resource identifiers. It allows users and developers to refer to human-readable and easy to remember names, and permits those names to be updated as necessary when the underlying resource (contract, content-addressed data, etc) changes. The goal of domain names is to provide stable, human-readable identifiers that can be used to specify network resources.

The ERC-181 proposal is related to ENS support for reverse resolution of Ethereum addresses because it provides a simpler and fully decentralized alternative to the ERC-672 proposal. It allows for the resolution of short, human-readable names to service and resource identifiers, which can be updated as necessary when the underlying resource changes. This is important because it allows users and developers to refer to human-readable and easy to remember names, which can be useful for a variety of purposes. The ERC-181 proposal also provides a unique address for all chains, which solves the problem of resolving the correct registry address for different chains. Overall, the ERC-181 proposal is an important step towards improving the functionality and usefulness of the Ethereum Name Service.
