ERC-5131 proposes using the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) to link one or more signing wallets to a main wallet, allowing for safer and more convenient signing operations. The current method of signing payloads of data to authenticate oneself before gaining access to perform some operation is insecure and inconvenient. The proposal aims to solve this problem by using ENS text records to facilitate safer and more convenient signing operations. The proposal includes specifications for setting up one or many authAddress records on a single ENS domain, authenticating mainAddress via authAddress, and revocation of authAddress. The proposal also includes a reference implementation for both client/server side and contract side. The motivation behind the proposal is to prove ownership of an asset to a third party application in the Ethereum ecosystem, which is common. The proposal aims to be human-friendly, simple to implement, secure, machine-readable, and extensible. The proposal also includes technical decisions such as using ERC-191 (Signed Data Standard) over EIP-712 (Ethereum typed structured data hashing and signing).
