EIP-3520 introduces a new EVM instruction called ENTRYPOINT, which provides access to the original recipient of a transaction. This enables contracts to identify the entry-point of a transaction on the blockchain and deduce the original intention of the transaction by applying introspection on the original transaction data itself. This can open new pathways for EIP-721 NFTs and EIP-20 tokens to detect which action their transaction is part of, such as detecting a liquidity provision to a decentralized exchange or a loan within a collateralized lending protocol. The behaviour of the ENTRYPOINT opcode during a contract creation will result in the opcode yielding the zero-address as the first address interacted with in the transaction. This should be taken into account by contract implementations to prevent software misbehaviours from arising. Overall, EIP-3520 provides a way for smart contracts to acquire access to the original transaction data at any given step in the call chain execution, which could result in cross-contract calls ultimately consuming less gas if the data passed between them is reduced as a side-effect of this change. However, the gas reduction would be an implementation-based optimization that would be solely applicable for rudimentary memory arguments rather than storage-based data, the latter of which is most commonly utilized in these types of calls. As a result, the overall gas reduction observed by this change will be negligible for most implementations.
