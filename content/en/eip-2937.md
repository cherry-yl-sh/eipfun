## Summary

EIP-2937 proposes the addition of a new opcode, SET_INDESTRUCTIBLE, to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) that prevents a contract from being destroyed using the SELFDESTRUCT opcode. This opcode is intended to be used by contracts that serve as libraries and want to guarantee to users that their code will exist unmodified forever. By making the first byte of code in a contract the SET_INDESTRUCTIBLE opcode, the contract can ensure that it cannot be destroyed, even if it is called by another contract that uses the SELFDESTRUCT opcode. 

The proposal suggests adding a new transaction-wide global variable, globals.indestructible, which operates in the same way as the existing selfdestructs set, to keep track of contracts that have used the SET_INDESTRUCTIBLE opcode. This variable would be initialized to an empty set. 

The proposal notes that alternative proposals to banning SELFDESTRUCT outright or using a local variable instead of a global variable have larger backwards compatibility issues or are problematic because they would be broken by DELEGATECALL. 

The proposal acknowledges that this EIP breaks forward compatibility with some forms of state rent, which would delete contracts that get too old without paying a maintenance fee. However, this is not an issue with all state size control schemes, such as ReGenesis. If SELFDESTRUCT is ever removed in the future, this EIP would become a no-op.
