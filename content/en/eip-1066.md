## Summary

ERC-1066 is a proposed standard for status codes in smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It aims to provide a common set of signals that can be used to allow smart contracts to react to situations autonomously, expose localized error messages to users, and more. The standard is similar to HTTP status codes and is intended to make it easier for developers to understand which of the finite states their request produced. The standard includes a format for the codes, a code table, and example function changes and sequence diagrams. The motivation behind the standard is to provide semantic density, familiarity, and human readability to smart contract status codes. The standard is also extensible, allowing for application-specific statuses and the use of larger byte arrays if 256 codes become insufficient. The proposal also includes the use of empty space and the ability to relay information beyond simply pass or fail. Overall, ERC-1066 aims to make smart contract development easier and more efficient by providing a standard set of known codes.
