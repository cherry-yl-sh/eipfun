EIP-1962 proposes a new precompile for cryptographic functions in Ethereum. This proposal extends and formalizes EIP-1829 with the inclusion of pairings. The main motivation behind this proposal is to estimate the gas cost of performed operations as early as possible during the call and base it solely on specified parameters and operation type. This is a strict requirement for any precompile to allow Ethereum nodes to efficiently reject transactions and operations as early as possible. The functionality of this newly proposed precompile is different from EIP-1829 in several aspects. It operates on arbitrary-length modulus (up to some upper limit) for a base field and scalar field of the curve, and pairing operations are introduced. Additionally, there is a different ABI due to variable parameter length. The proposal covers only the largest design decisions, including the fact that there is no arithmetic over the scalar field (which is modulo size of the main group) of the curve, but it's required for gas estimation purposes. Multiexponentiation is a separate operation due to large cost savings, and there are no point decompressions due to impossibility to get universal gas estimation of square root operation. The proposal also discusses possible simplifications, rationale, backwards compatibility, implementation details, preliminary benchmarks, and copyright information. Overall, EIP-1962 aims to improve the efficiency and security of cryptographic functions in Ethereum by introducing a new precompile that estimates gas costs more accurately while supporting arbitrary-length modulus and pairing operations.
