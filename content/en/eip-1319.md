ERC-1319 proposes a standard interface for a smart contract package registry, which would allow developers to easily publish and discover packages of smart contracts. The registry would include metadata about the package, such as its name, version, and dependencies, as well as the bytecode for the smart contracts included in the package. The interface would also allow for querying and filtering packages based on various criteria. The goal of this standard is to improve the discoverability and reusability of smart contract code, which would increase productivity and security in the Ethereum ecosystem.
