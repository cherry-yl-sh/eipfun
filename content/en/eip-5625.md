The ERC-5625 proposal suggests adding a dStorage property to the non-fungible tokens (NFTs) metadata JSON schema to provide decentralized storage information of NFT assets. The proposal extends the NFT metadata JSON schema defined in EIP-721 and EIP-1155, adding a dStorage key that provides information about how the NFT data is stored. The proposal aims to promote the use of reliable and verifiable decentralized storage systems to store larger amounts of data than the blockchain itself. The proposal is backward compatible, and existing projects that can't modify the metadata response (schema) may be able to create a new smart contract that based on the tokenId returns the updated metadata schema. The proposal also highlights the same security considerations as with EIP-721 related to using http gateways or IPFS for the tokenURI method.
