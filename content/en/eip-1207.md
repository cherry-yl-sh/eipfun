The ERC-1207 is a standard interface for accessing authorization delegation between smart contracts and users. It defines a set of standard APIs allowing identity delegations between smart contracts without the user's private key. This includes accessing and operating a user's data and assets contained in the delegated contracts. The DAuth protocol is inspired by the OAuth protocol used in web applications, but it works in a distributed manner, providing more reliability and generality. The standard includes several components such as the resource owner (the authorizer), the resource contract (the contract providing data and operators), the client contract (the grantee contract using authorization to access and operate the data), and the grantee request (the client contract calls the resource contract with the authorizer authorization). The standard also includes the AuthInfo struct, which contains user authorization information, including a list of function names callable by the granted contract and the authorization expire timestamp in seconds. The userAuth mapping maps the (authorizer address, grantee contract address) pair to the user's authorization AuthInfo object. The callableFuncNames list includes all methods that are allowed other contracts to call, and the callable function must verify the grantee's authorization. The updateCallableFuncNames function updates the callableFuncNames list. The ERC-DAuth Interface implementation is available on GitHub, and an example implementation with EIP20 Interface and ERC-DAuth Interface is also available.
