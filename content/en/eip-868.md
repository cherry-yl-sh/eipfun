## Summary

The EIP-868 proposal defines an extension to Node Discovery Protocol v4 on the Ethereum blockchain to enable authoritative resolution of Ethereum Node Records (ENR). Its purpose is to provide a way to request the most up-to-date version of a node record using the existing discovery protocol, and to bridge current and future discovery networks and aid the implementation of other relay mechanisms for ENR such as DNS.
