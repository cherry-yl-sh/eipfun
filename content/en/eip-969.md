EIP-969 proposes modifications to the ethash mining algorithm in order to break ASIC miners that are currently in production and may be actively mining. The goal is to "poison the well" and prevent centralization of mining power by making GPU-based mining more profitable. The proposal requires that the ethash solution sealing the block has been mined using ethashV2 if block.number is greater than or equal to ASIC_MITIGATION_FORK_BLKNUM. This change is a backwards incompatible change to proof of work based block mining, and all existing miners will be required to update to clients which implement this new algorithm. Test cases and implementation details are still to be determined.
