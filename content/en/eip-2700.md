EIP-2700 proposes a standard mechanism for JavaScript Ethereum Providers to notify clients about chain state changes when both are able to interface with each other via a shared JavaScript object. It provides the description of an object that is made available to JavaScript applications which they can use to receive notifications from an Ethereum Provider. This standard only describes the notification mechanism, it does not specify the payloads that are valid nor does it specify how the client or the provider will discover or agree on payload content. The specific events that can be listened to and the shape of their listener callback functions is left to be defined in separate standards.
