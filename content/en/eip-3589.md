## Summary

EIP-3589 proposes the creation of a new ERC-721 token called an assembly token, which can represent a combination of assets such as ether, ERC-20 tokens, ERC-721 tokens, and ERC-1155 tokens. This would allow for batch transfer or swap of multiple assets in a single transaction, making it more efficient and less gas-intensive than current methods. The motivation behind this proposal is to provide a safer and more efficient way for collectors to swap NFTs, as currently they often rely on third parties or inefficient market listings. The specification includes a generic system for the creation of non-fungible tokens tied to physical assets, with a focus on ensuring the authenticity of the asset and avoiding identity theft. The proposal also includes recommendations for the creation and management of assembly tokens, such as only allowing the manufacturer of the asset to create its associated token. Overall, EIP-3589 aims to improve the functionality and efficiency of NFT trading by allowing for the assembly of multiple assets into a single token.
