ERC-1388, titled "Attestation Issuers Management List," proposes a smart contract interface for managing a list of attestation issuers. This is particularly useful in scenarios where attestations to a user's identifier or abilities are required. For example, a real estate agent might require users to provide an attestation that they are a resident of a particular country.rnrnThe ERC envisions a model where the effort to manage the list of qualified issuers is outsourced to a list. Anyone can publish a list of issuers, and only the most trusted and carefully maintained lists get popular use.rnrnThe ERC provides a smart contract interface for anyone to manage a list of attestation issuers. A smart contract would explicitly trust a list, and therefore all attestations issued by the issuers on the list.rnrnThe ERC introduces a ManagedListERC contract with a List struct that includes the name, description, capacity, issuerContracts, and expiry. It also introduces several functions, including addIssuer, removeIssuer, and getIssuerCorrespondingToAttestationKey.rnrnThe rationale behind this ERC is to provide a flexible and trustless way to manage attestations, reducing the need for smart contracts to explicitly trust an attestation issuer.
