ERC-6366, titled "Permission Token," proposes a new token type that represents the permissions of an address within an ecosystem. This proposal aims to improve the management and auditability of permissions within smart contracts.

The proposal introduces a new interface, IEIP6366Core, which includes functions like transfer, approve, permissionOf, permissionRequire, hasPermission, and delegated. These functions allow for the transfer of permissions, approval of permissions for delegatees, checking of permissions, and checking if a required permission is a subset of a given permission.

The document also introduces an optional extension, IEIP6366Meta, which provides a structure for permission descriptions. This includes a PermissionDescription struct and functions like name, symbol, getDescription, and setDescription.

The proposal also introduces an IEIP6366Error interface for error handling, which includes errors like AccessDenied, DuplicatedPermission, and OutOfRange.

The rationale behind this proposal is to simplify cross-interactivity between many ecosystems by reflecting permission and role through the permission token balance of the relevant account in the given ecosystem. The document mentions that there are no known backward compatibility issues or security considerations associated with this proposal. The test cases, reference implementation, and security considerations are yet to be determined.
