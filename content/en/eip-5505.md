ERC-5505 is a proposed extension of the EIP-1155 standard for smart contract interfaces that would support asset-backed, fractionalized projects. The proposal aims to address the difficulty faced by fractionalized, asset-backed NFTs when someone wants to acquire the whole asset. Currently, if someone wants to acquire all NFT pieces to become the 100% owner, it is publicly visible, and sellers may take advantage by setting unreasonable high prices. Alternatively, NFTs may be owned by wallets with lost keys, making complete ownership impossible. The proposal suggests adding functionalities to support total acquisition, such as setting the percentage required for any acquirer to trigger a forced sale and the payment token to settle for the acquisition. EIP-1155 compliant contracts may implement this EIP to add these functionalities.
