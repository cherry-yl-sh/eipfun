EIP-6404 proposes a migration process of existing Merkle-Patricia Trie (MPT) commitments for transactions to Simple Serialize (SSZ) in Ethereum. This aims to align the encoding of the transactions_root, taking advantage of the more modern SSZ format. This brings several advantages, including better support for light clients who no longer need to obtain and decode entire transactions to verify transaction related fields provided by the execution JSON-RPC API, including information about the transactionâ€™s signer and the transaction hash. The EIP also provides specifications for existing definitions, consensus ExecutionPayload building, consensus ExecutionPayload changes, consensus ExecutionPayloadHeader changes, execution block header changes, handling reorgs, consensus ExecutionPayload validation, and more. The proposal is still in draft form and was last updated on January 30, 2023.
