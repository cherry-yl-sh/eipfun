The ERC-5883 proposal for Token Transfer by Social Recovery is a standardized mechanism for transferring tokens from an inaccessible account to a new account, with the approval of other identities. This approval is not purely technical, but rather requires human intervention. The proposal introduces the concept of "Souls" - individuals who can approve or deny the transfer of tokens. When enough Souls give their approval and a threshold is reached, the tokens are transferred to the new identity. The proposal aims to address the problem of lost private keys, which can result in the permanent loss of tokens. The proposal includes functions for approving and requesting transfers, as well as adding and removing neighbours. The proposal uses a nearest-neighbour approach to determine which identities can approve a transfer. The contract relies on usage, and if it is not used, it will become useless.
