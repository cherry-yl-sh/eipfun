The ERC-5700 proposal defines a standard interface for "bindable" tokens, which can be bound to ERC-721 non-fungible tokens (NFTs). When a bindable token is bound to an NFT, its ownership is transferred to the NFT, but the NFT owner can still unbind the token and claim ownership. This allows for more efficient bundling and transfer of tokens with NFTs, without the need for implementation-specific strategies for token ownership. The proposal supports various use-cases, such as bundling physical assets like microchipped streetwear and digitized car collections, as well as digital assets like accessorizable virtual wardrobes and customizable metaverse land. The proposal aims to build a universal interface for token bundling that is compatible with existing ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards.
