## Summary

The ERC-1996, also known as the Holdable Token, is an extension to the ERC-20 standard token that allows tokens to be put on hold. This guarantees a future transfer and makes the held tokens unavailable for transfer in the meantime. Holds are similar to escrows in that they are firm and lead to final settlement. The standard introduces several new functions and modifies some existing ones.

New functions include `hold`, `holdFrom`, `releaseHold`, `executeHold`, `renewHold`, `retrieveHoldData`, `balanceOnHold`, `netBalanceOf`, `totalSupplyOnHold`, `authorizeHoldOperator`, `revokeHoldOperator`, and `isHoldOperatorFor`. These functions allow for the creation of holds, releasing and executing holds, renewing holds, retrieving hold data, and managing hold operators.

The `hold` function creates a hold on behalf of the msg.sender in favor of the payee. The `releaseHold` function releases a hold, making the held amount available again for the payer. The `executeHold` function executes a hold, transferring a specified value from the payer to the payee. The `renewHold` function renews a hold, setting a new expiration time.

The standard also modifies the `balanceOf`, `transfer`, and `transferFrom` functions of the ERC-20 standard to deduct the held balance from the ERC-20 balance. Any amount that is held must not be transferred.

The standard also introduces several events, including `HoldCreated`, `HoldExecuted`, `HoldReleased`, `HoldRenewed`, `AuthorizedHoldOperator`, and `RevokedHoldOperator`, which are emitted when the corresponding actions occur.
