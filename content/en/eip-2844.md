## Summary

The EIP-2844 proposal suggests adding three new methods to the JSON-RPC in Ethereum to enable wallets to support Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE). These methods would allow apps to request the DID from a user's wallet, from which a DID document can be resolved containing public keys for encryption and signature verification. This would enable users to discover public keys by only knowing a DID, and would support a wide range of new use cases such as traditional authentication using JWTs and encrypted data in IPFS. The proposal does not enforce the use of any particular DID method or JOSE algorithms, allowing wallets to implement them as they wish.
