ERC-5252 is a proposal for a new type of smart contract design pattern and account abstraction that aims to manage one's finance transparently and protect it with self-sovereignty, even from financial operators. The proposal extends ERC-5114 to enable transferring funds to other accounts for mobility between managing multiple wallets. The separation between an investor's funds and the operation fee is clearly specified in the personal smart contract, ensuring safety from arbitrary loss of funds by the operating team's control. The proposal aims to address the trust issue in decentralized finance (DeFi) by enabling greater self-sovereignty of one's assets using a personal finance contract for each individual. The proposal also aims to save gas costs for end-users by using one contract per user instead of multiple contracts storing users' states globally. The proposal has no known backward compatibility issues and includes security considerations such as reentrancy attack guard and double influence prevention. Overall, ERC-5252 aims to provide a more secure and transparent way of managing one's finance in the DeFi space.
