ERC-5732 proposes a simple commit interface to support commit-reveal schemes for applications such as voting. It provides a commit method but no reveal method, allowing implementations to integrate this interface with arbitrary reveal methods. The proposal aims to make it harder for attackers to perform front-running, back-running, or sandwich attacks. The specification includes two interfaces, IERC_COMMIT_CORE and IERC_COMMIT_GENERAL, and references other related proposals such as EIP-165 and EIP-1271.
