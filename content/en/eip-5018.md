The ERC-5018 standard is an API for directories and files within smart contracts, similar to traditional filesystems. It provides basic functionality to read/write binary objects of any size, as well as allow reading/writing chunks of the object if the object is too large to fit in a single transaction. This standard allows any binary objects on EVM-based blockchain to be re-used by other dApps.
