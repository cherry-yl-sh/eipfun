EIP-3554 proposes a delay to the Ethereum difficulty bomb until December 2021. The difficulty bomb is a mechanism that increases the difficulty of mining Ethereum over time, making it more challenging to mine new blocks. This is intended to encourage the transition to a new consensus algorithm, but it can also cause issues if left unchecked. The EIP proposes to delay the difficulty bomb to give more time for the transition to the new consensus algorithm, which is still in development. The delay would also allow for more time to address other issues with the Ethereum network, such as high gas fees and scalability. The proposal has not yet been implemented, and tests have not been completed. There are no known backward compatibility issues, and the delay is unlikely to have security ramifications. Overall, the proposal aims to improve the usability and stability of the Ethereum network by delaying the difficulty bomb and giving more time for development and testing.
