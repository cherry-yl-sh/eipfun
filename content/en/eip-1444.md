## Summary

ERC-1444 proposes a method for converting machine codes into human-readable text in any language and phrasing. The system allows users to create, share, and use localized text of their choice, rather than imposing a list of languages. The motivation behind this proposal is to provide better user experience by returning easier to consume information with more context. The specification includes contract architecture, localization, localization preferences, string format, templates, and rationale. The use of bytes32 keys is preferred due to its efficiency, and the spec allows for the deployment of individual systems rather than a single global registry. The proposal aims to enable richer messaging that is more culturally and linguistically diverse, enhancing the developer and end-user experience.
