ERC-1620 is a draft proposal for a new standard in Ethereum called "Money Streaming." It aims to provide a way for users to stream payments to a recipient over a period of time, rather than sending a lump sum all at once. This could be useful for things like paying rent or salaries, where a regular payment schedule is needed. The standard would allow for customization of the payment schedule, such as the frequency and duration of payments, and would also include features like the ability to cancel or pause the stream. The proposal is fully decentralized and compatible with existing wallets and exchanges.
