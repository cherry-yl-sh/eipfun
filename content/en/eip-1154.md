ERC-1154 is a standard interface for oracles in the Ethereum ecosystem. Oracles are used to report values from off-chain systems to smart contracts, allowing them to react to the state of those systems. The interface provides a standardized way for different oracle implementations to be interchangeable, rather than locking smart contract systems into a single set of oracle implementations or requiring developers to write adapters specific to the chosen oracle system. The interface also distinguishes between push and pull based oracle systems, which have different system semantics that could introduce inefficiencies when adapting between them. The ID field in the interface can be structured to specify "what" and "when" for the data, and the results are intentionally unstructured to allow for different types of data representation. The interface can be used for answering questions about real-world events, such as in prediction markets, or for decision-making processes in DAOs. The document provides a detailed specification for the interface.
