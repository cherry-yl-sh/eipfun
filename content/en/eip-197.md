EIP-197 proposes the addition of precompiled contracts for a pairing function on a specific elliptic curve, which can be combined with EIP-196 to verify zkSNARKs in Ethereum smart contracts. The motivation behind this proposal is to increase privacy for users and potentially provide a scalability solution. Currently, zkSNARKs are too expensive to fit within the block gas limit, but specifying certain parameters for some elementary primitives can make their implementation more efficient and reduce gas costs. This proposal does not limit the use-cases for zkSNARKs and allows for incorporating advances in zkSNARK research without the need for a further hard fork. In summary, EIP-197 is a proposal for precompiled contracts that enable zkSNARK verification within the block gas limit, and it relates to EIP-196 in terms of combining with it to verify zkSNARKs in Ethereum smart contracts.
