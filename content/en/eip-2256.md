EIP-2256 proposes a new JSON-RPC call for retrieving a selection of owned assets by an Ethereum address from a wallet, with the user's permission. Currently, dApps need to keep a list of all popular or existing assets and check the user's balance against the blockchain for each asset, leading to duplicated effort and non-optimal user experience. The proposed method, wallet_getOwnedAssets, allows dApps to request a list of owned assets from the user's wallet, which can manage only the assets the user is interested in. The wallet should display a UI to the user, showing the request, and the user can accept, reject, or amend the request. The method includes optional parameters for restricting the selection list and an upper limit of accounts that the user can select. The response fields provide asset-specific options, enabling better UX through using the same visual and text identifiers that the wallet uses. The balance response field is an optimization, allowing dApps to show the user's balance without querying the blockchain. This proposal aims to avoid duplication of effort for dApps and provide optimal UX.
