ERC-3772, titled "Compressed Integers," proposes a method for compressing uint256 to smaller data structures like uint64, uint96, and uint128 to optimize storage costs. The smaller data structure, represented as cintx, is divided into two parts: the significant bits and the number of left shifts needed to decompress. The proposal is motivated by the high cost of storage and the fact that most money amounts stored in uint256 take up one entire slot, which is often wasteful.

The proposed compression method reserves the rightmost bits in cintx for storing the shift, and the remaining bits are used to store the significant bits. Two decompression methods are defined: a normal decompress and a decompressRoundingUp. The significant bits in the cintx are moved to a uint256 space and shifted left by shift in the normal decompression method. In the decompressRoundingUp method, the significant bits in the cintx are moved to a uint256 space, shifted left by shift, and the least significant shift bits are 1s.

The document also discusses security considerations and potential errors due to lossy compression. It emphasizes that compression is only useful when writing to storage, and arithmetic with them should be done very carefully. The document also mentions that there are no known backward-incompatible issues associated with this proposal.
