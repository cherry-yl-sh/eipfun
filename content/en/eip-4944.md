## Summary

The ERC-4944 proposal suggests modifying the ERC-721 standard to allow for the creation of contracts with exactly one non-fungible token (NFT). This would enable the NFT to be uniquely associated with a single contract address, simplifying the identification process. The proposal also suggests that this change would allow for the automatic capabilities of composable tokens ERC-998, without the need for additional code. The NFT minted with this contract would be able to operate with its own budget of ERC-20 coins and trade with other NFTs it may own. The proposal suggests that this would be useful for value preservation of digital assets, as the NFT could use its own budget to autopreserve itself. The specification for the proposal suggests that the constructor should mint the unique token of the contract, and then the mint function should add a restriction to avoid further minting.
