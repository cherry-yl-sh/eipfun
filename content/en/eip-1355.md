## Summary

EIP-1355 proposes an update to the Ethash algorithm used for mining Ethereum. The update, called Ethash 1a, aims to improve the efficiency and security of the mining process. It introduces a new hash function and changes the way the DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) is generated, which should make it more resistant to ASIC mining. The proposal also includes changes to the way the difficulty is calculated, which should make it more stable and predictable. Overall, the goal of EIP-1355 is to make mining more accessible and fair, while also improving the security of the Ethereum network.
