ERC-6220 is a proposal for a standardized framework for composable NFTs, where a single NFT can select which parts should be a part of the whole, with the information being on chain. This allows for virtually unbounded customization of the base NFT. The proposal introduces two types of parts; slot type of parts and fixed type of parts. The slot type of parts allow for other NFT collections to be equipped into them, while fixed parts are full components with their own metadata. Equipping a part into an NFT doesnâ€™t generate a new token, but rather adds another component to be rendered when retrieving the token. This proposal improves upon ERC-721 in the areas of composing, token progression, merit tracking, and provable digital scarcity. It allows for tokens to be composed by cherry picking the list of parts from a Catalog for each NFT instance, and are able to equip other NFTs into slots, which are also defined within the Catalog. Catalogs contain parts from which NFTs can be composed. This proposal provides greater utility, usability, and forward compatibility for NFTs.
