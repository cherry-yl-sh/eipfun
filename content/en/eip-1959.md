EIP-1959 proposes adding a new opcode called VALID_CHAINID that checks if a specific chainID has been a valid identifier in the history of the chain, including the current chainID. This is related to the problem of protecting off-chain messages from being reused across different chains, and the need for smart contracts to only accept messages for the correct chain. EIP-1344 attempted to solve this by giving smart contracts access to the tip of the chainID history, but EIP-1959 proposes a simpler, cheaper, and safer solution.
