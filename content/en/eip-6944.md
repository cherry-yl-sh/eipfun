The ERC-6944 proposal adds a new ERC-4804 resolveMode to resolve ERC-5219 contract resource requests. This means that contracts wishing to use ERC-5219 as their ERC-4804 resolve mode must implement the IERC5219Resolver interface, which includes a function called resolveMode that returns "5219" for ERC-5219 resolution. The proposal also includes security considerations and a reference implementation. The rationale for not using ERC-165 is that interoperability can be checked by calling resolveMode. There are no backward compatibility issues found.
