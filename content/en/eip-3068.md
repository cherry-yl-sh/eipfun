## Summary

The purpose of the hash-to-curve precompile defined in EIP-3068 is to provide a cheaper way to perform BLS signature verification for arbitrary messages by implementing a hash-to-curve algorithm for the BN256 elliptic curve. This would reduce the cost of signature verification to essentially that of the pairing check precompiled contract.
