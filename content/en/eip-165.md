## Summary

The ERC-165 proposal is a standard interface detection used to expose the interfaces that an ERC-721 smart contract supports. Its purpose is to allow for future EIPs to create a global registry of interfaces for contracts, which would allow ERC-721 implementations to implement other interfaces by delegating to a separate contract.
