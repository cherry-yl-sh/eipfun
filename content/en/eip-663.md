EIP-663 proposes the introduction of two new instructions, SWAPN and DUPN, which will allow accessing the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) stack up to a depth of 256 items, lifting the current limitation of 16. The motivation behind this proposal is to simplify accessing deep stack items, which can be complex and inefficient when using the current method of manually keeping them in memory or through a "stack to memory elevation" in a compiler. Additionally, implementing higher-level constructs such as functions on top of EVM can result in a list of input and output parameters that can easily exceed 16, requiring extra care from a compiler to lay them out in a way that all of them are still accessible. The introduction of SWAPN and DUPN will provide an option to compilers to simplify accessing deep stack items at the price of possibly increased gas costs. The proposal introduces two new instructions, DUPN (0xb5) and SWAPN (0xb6), which are followed by an 8-bit immediate value, called imm, and can have a value of 0 to 255. The variable n is introduced, which equals imm + 1. If the current stack height is less than n, then a stack underflow exception is issued for DUPN. If the code is legacy bytecode, both of these instructions result in an exceptional halt, meaning no change to behavior. EIP-663 is currently in the process of being peer-reviewed.
