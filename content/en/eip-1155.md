The ERC-1155: Multi Token Standard is a new standard for smart contracts that manage multiple token types. Unlike previous standards like ERC-20 and ERC-721, which require separate contracts for each token type, ERC-1155 allows for any combination of fungible, non-fungible, and semi-fungible tokens to be included in a single contract. This reduces redundant bytecode on the Ethereum blockchain and allows for new functionality like transferring multiple token types at once and trading multiple tokens through escrow or atomic swaps. The standard also removes the need to "approve" individual token contracts separately. ERC-1155 is not specific to games and can be used in many other applications. Smart contracts implementing the ERC-1155 standard must implement all of the functions in the ERC1155 interface and the ERC-165 supportsInterface function. The standard also includes rules for safe transfers, metadata, and approval. Overall, ERC-1155 provides greater flexibility and efficiency for managing multiple token types in smart contracts.
