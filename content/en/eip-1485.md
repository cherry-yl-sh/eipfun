EIP-1485 proposes a new version of the Ethash algorithm, called TEthashV1, which is designed to be more ASIC-resistant and improve the security of the Ethereum network. The proposal includes changes to the algorithm's mix function, which is used to generate the final hash, as well as adjustments to the DAG size and epoch length. The goal is to make it more difficult and expensive for ASICs to mine Ethereum, which would help to decentralize the network and prevent a single entity from controlling a significant portion of the hash rate. The proposal also includes a transition plan to gradually phase in the new algorithm and ensure a smooth upgrade process for miners and other stakeholders. Overall, EIP-1485 aims to improve the long-term sustainability and security of the Ethereum network by making it more resistant to centralization and attacks.
