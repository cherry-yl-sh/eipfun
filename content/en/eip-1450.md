ERC-1450 is a proposed Ethereum Improvement Proposal that defines a compatible security token for issuing and trading SEC-compliant securities. It is an ERC-20 compatible token that enables the issuance of tokens representing securities that comply with Securities Act Regulations CF, D, and A. The token facilitates the recording of ownership and transfer of securities sold in compliance with these regulations. The issuance and trading of securities is subject to the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) and specific U.S. state blue sky laws and regulations. The proposal includes specifications for issuers and registered transfer agents, an ERC-20 extension, managing investor information, and handling lost access to addresses or private keys. The motivation behind ERC-1450 is the expansion of exemptions available to issuers and investors to sell and purchase securities that have not been registered with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933. The proposal aims to provide a standard for security tokens that comply with legal requirements such as KYC and AML regulations, and the ability to lock tokens for an account and restrict them from transfer due to a legal dispute. ERC-1450 is one of several security token standards proposed recently, and its scope is kept as narrow as possible to avoid restricting potential use-cases of this base security token.
