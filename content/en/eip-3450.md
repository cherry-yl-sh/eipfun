The proposal in ERC-3450 is to standardize the implementation of Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme specifically for BIP-39 mnemonics. This would allow users to easily create shares of their mnemonic, destroy the original, store the shares appropriately, and confidently recover the original mnemonic at a later date. The motivation behind this proposal is to make it easier for less-technical users to store keys securely. Currently, many users use BIP-39 mnemonics to store entropy values underlying their keys, but these mnemonics are a single point of failure. If lost or stolen, the user may never regain access to the assets locked by the keys. 

Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme addresses this concern directly by creating "shares" of the secret, such that a subset can be used to recover the secret, but only if a minimum threshold of shares is reached. However, there is currently no canonical, standard implementation of this scheme, which puts recovery at risk as tooling may change over time. 

The proposal in ERC-3450 aims to standardize the implementation of Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme for BIP-39 mnemonics, so that users can easily create shares of their mnemonic and confidently recover the original mnemonic at a later date. The proposal includes specifications for applying Shamir's Scheme to BIP-39 mnemonics, creating shares, and recovering the mnemonic. It also includes security considerations, such as the need to obscure the ID used to recover the original mnemonic, in order to prevent attackers from inferring the existence of other keys and the scheme under which they are stored. Overall, the proposal aims to improve the security and usability of BIP-39 mnemonics for storing keys.
