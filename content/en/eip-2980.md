The ERC-2980 proposal introduces a new standard for asset tokens that are compliant with Swiss law and compatible with the ERC-20 token standard. These asset tokens represent assets and/or relative rights and are analogous to shares, bonds, or derivatives. The proposal specifies that the token must comply with various Swiss financial market laws, including the Stock Exchange Act, Banking Act, Financial Market Infrastructure Act, Act on Collective Investment Schemes, Anti-Money Laundering Act, Financial Services Act, and Financial Institutions Act. The issuer of the token is the only role that can manage a white-listing and execute freeze or revoke functions. The proposal is backward compatible with ERC-20 and allows for the implementation of transfer, transferFrom, approve, and allowance functions. The security considerations mainly concern the role played by the issuers, who have powerful rights that allow them to move tokens without being in possession and freeze other addresses. It is the responsibility of the owner to ensure that the addresses that receive this charge remain in possession of it only for the time for which they have been designated to do so, thus preventing any abuse.
