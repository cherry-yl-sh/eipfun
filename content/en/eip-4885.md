## Summary

ERC-4885 proposes a standard API for subscription tokens that allow holders to subscribe to non-fungible and multi tokens (referred to as NFTs) for a specified time period. The proposal aims to provide a flexible and general-purpose way for users to subscribe to assets or services offered by EIP-721 or EIP-1155 contracts. The proposal was initially conceived to give creators of music and film more control over the distribution and delivery of their digital content. The proposal specifies a standard for dapp developers to give creators the ability to set their own custom subscription models, which can lead to new revenue streams and decentralised distribution and delivery models. The use cases for subscription NFTs and multi tokens include subscriptions for streaming music, video, e-learning or book/news services, sharing of digital assets among subscribers, club memberships such as health clubs, and season tickets for sports and e-sports. The proposal specifies the subscription token balances, subscription token price, NFT metadata, and subscription expiry. The proposal also highlights security considerations, such as the possibility of service providers receiving subscriber payments upfront and not providing the service or providing it poorly. The proposal recommends that the uri link to the NFT metadata is stored on immutable storage to prevent changes or hacks. Overall, ERC-4885 aims to give users more control over their subscriptions and provide a standard API for subscription NFTs and multi tokens in Ethereum.
