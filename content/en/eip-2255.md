EIP-2255 proposes a new system for managing wallet permissions in Ethereum. The current system relies on externally owned accounts (EOAs) and their private keys to authorize transactions. This can be problematic in situations where multiple parties need to authorize a transaction, or when a user wants to delegate transaction signing to a smart contract.

The proposed system introduces the concept of "wallet contracts," which are smart contracts that manage permissions for a user's funds. These contracts can be set up to require multiple signatures or approvals before a transaction can be executed, allowing for more secure and flexible management of funds.

Wallet contracts can also be used to delegate transaction signing to a smart contract, allowing for more complex transaction logic and reducing the risk of private key exposure. Additionally, the proposed system includes a mechanism for revoking permissions in case of a compromised key or other security breach.

Overall, EIP-2255 aims to improve the security and usability of Ethereum wallets by introducing a more flexible and secure system for managing permissions.
