The proposal in EIP-3416 is to replace the current "first price auction" fee model in Ethereum with a mechanism that allows dynamically priced transaction fees and efficient transaction price discovery. It suggests using an "escalating" bid system where each transaction would have the option of providing parameters that specify a bid, creating a time-based auction for validators to include that transaction. This creates highly efficient price discovery, where the price will always immediately fall to the highest bid price, which is not necessarily that user's highest price they would pay. The proposal also includes a base fee amount that is adjusted up and down by the protocol based on how congested the network is, allowing wallets to auto-set gas fees for users in a highly reliable fashion. Miners only get to keep the priority fee, while the base fee is always burned, ensuring that only ETH can ever be used to pay for transactions on Ethereum and reducing risks associated with miner extractable value (MEV).
