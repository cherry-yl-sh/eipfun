## Summary

The ERC-5635 proposal standardizes an NFT licensing oracle to store and retrieve granted licensing agreements for non-fungible token (NFT) derivative works, which are also NFTs but are created using properties of some other underlying NFTs. The proposal outlines the roles of the licensor, licensee, and original underlying NFT (oNFT) in the licensing agreement process. The licensor, who is the owner of the oNFT, may authorize a licensee to create derivative works (dNFTs) in exchange for an agreed payment, known as a Royalty. The licensing agreement outlines the terms and conditions related to the deal between the licensor and licensee. The proposal also discusses the difference between CantBeEvil Licenses and Licensing Agreements, and the relationship between different approval levels. The proposal uses key words such as "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" to interpret the document as described in RFC 2119. The proposal aims to provide a standardized approach to NFT licensing agreements and to ensure backwards compatibility and security considerations.
