ERC-5805 proposes a standardized interface for tracking voting weight with delegation support in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) that rely on tokens to represent voting power. The proposal aims to address the limitations of existing implementations, which do not include mechanisms such as checkpoints and delegation. The proposal allows users to delegate their voting power to themselves or a third party, creating a distinction between balance and voting weight. The voting weights of accounts are checkpointed, allowing lookups for past values at different points in time, while the balances are not checkpointed. The proposal also allows the voting token to use any time tracking function it wants, and exposes it so that other contracts can stay consistent with the token checkpoints. Each user account can delegate to an account of its choice, and assets held by the user cannot express their voting power unless they are delegated. When a delegator delegates its tokens voting power to a delegatee, its balance is added to the voting power of the delegatee. If the delegator changes its delegation, the voting power is subtracted from the old delegateeâs voting power and added to the new delegateâs voting power. The proposal aims to prevent double voting by allowing tokens to be delegated to at most one delegate at a given point in time.
