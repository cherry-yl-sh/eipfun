The ERC-5559 proposal is for the Cross Chain Write Deferral Protocol, which provides a mechanism for deferring the storage and resolution of mutations to off-chain handlers. This allows protocols to reduce gas fees associated with storing data on mainnet by deferring the handling of it to another system/network. The protocol outlines a set of handler types that can be used for managing the execution and storage of mutations, as well as their corresponding tradeoffs. Each handler type has associated operational costs, finality guarantees, and levels of decentralization. By specifying the type of handler that the mutation is deferred to, the protocol can better define how to permission and secure their system.
