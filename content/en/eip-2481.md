EIP-2481 proposes a new identifier for Ethereum transactions called "eth/66 request identifier". This identifier would be used to uniquely identify a transaction and prevent replay attacks. The proposal suggests using a combination of the transaction's nonce, gas price, gas limit, to address, value, and input data to create the identifier. The proposal also includes a specification for how the identifier should be encoded and decoded. The main benefit of this proposal is that it would make it easier for clients to identify and track transactions, which could improve the overall efficiency and security of the Ethereum network. However, there are some concerns about the potential impact on backward compatibility and the need for further testing and analysis before the proposal can be fully implemented.
