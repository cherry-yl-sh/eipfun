The ERC-1484 proposal is for a protocol that aggregates digital identity information in a way that is interoperable with existing and future digital identity standards. It aims to solve the challenges of identity management and interoperability by introducing a protocol layer between the Ethereum network and individual identity applications. The protocol includes an Identity Registry, which is a single smart contract that defines and enforces the rules of a global namespace for identities denominated by Ethereum Identification Numbers (EINs). The protocol also includes Address Management, Provider Management, Resolver Management, and Recovery features. The proposal is motivated by the proliferation of on-chain identity solutions, which can become burdensome for blockchain users and developers due to the duplication of work and lack of coordination. The ERC-1484 proposal aims to provide an un-opinionated identity management protocol that any identity-driven application can leverage.
