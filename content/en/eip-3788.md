## Summary

EIP-3788 proposes strict enforcement of chainId to prevent malicious actors from deploying a network with chainId = 1 or copying any other network's chainId. However, this may break applications or tooling that submit transactions with a chainId == 0 after a certain block number. Security considerations and test cases are still being discussed.
