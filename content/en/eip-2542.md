The EIP-2542 proposal introduces new opcodes called TXGASLIMIT and CALLGASLIMIT for gas limits in Ethereum. These opcodes are not proposed for deprecation and do not introduce any new concepts for EVM. The proposal is related to the ongoing project of Stateless Ethereum and is aimed at making future breaking changes to gas schedules easier. Existing smart contracts are not affected by this change, and smart contracts that will use proposed opcodes must not use them for the core of any security features, but only as a source of information about their execution environment. The implementation of the proposal must be completed before it is given status "Final," but it need not be completed before the proposal is accepted.
