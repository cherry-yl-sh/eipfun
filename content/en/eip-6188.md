The EIP-6188 proposal suggests implementing a cap on the nonce value for contract accounts in Ethereum. This is because contract accounts are unlikely to reach the nonce limit, and any potential problems with opcodes that depend on the value of an account's nonce can be safely ignored. The proposal outlines the necessary parts of a successful EIP, including a preamble, abstract, and optional motivation section. The Last Call status is the final review window for an EIP before moving to Final, and any necessary normative changes during this period will revert the EIP to Review. A Final EIP represents the final standard and should only be updated to correct errata and add non-normative clarifications. The EIP-6188 proposal is available online and was last updated in December 2022.
