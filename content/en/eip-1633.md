The ERC-1633 proposal suggests extending the ERC-20 Token Standard to represent shared ownership of an ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token. This would allow for the creation of a new class of token, the Re-Fungible Token (RFT), which would have a value attached to the non-fungible tokens it represents. This would be useful for price discovery, liquidity, and as a new class of asset that could be used as collateral for loans or other financial instruments. The proposal outlines the minimum requirements for third parties to be able to distinguish RFTs from other token standards and to determine when a non-fungible token is collectively owned. The proposal includes an interface for the RFT, which includes functions to retrieve the parent token and parent token ID. The proposal also includes a section on security considerations, which is currently marked as "TBD" (to be determined). Overall, the proposal aims to provide an interface for a special class of fungible tokens that represent shared ownership of non-fungible tokens, which could have various use cases in the future.
