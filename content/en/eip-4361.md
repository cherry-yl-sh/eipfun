ERC-4361 is a specification for a decentralized, open, and non-proprietary sign-in process using Ethereum accounts for authentication. The core specification includes Ethereum accounts, ENS names for usernames, and data from ENS name's text records for additional profile information. The user is presented with a human-friendly interface prior to signing, and the application server can implement support without forcing a change in wallets. The specification also includes guidelines for mitigating Man-in-the-Middle attacks, replay attacks, and malicious signing requests. The design goals are human-friendly, simple to implement, secure, machine-readable, and extensible. The technical decision is to use ERC-191 for signed data standard over EIP-712. The reference implementation is available, and security considerations include identifier reuse and key management. The wallet and relying party must implement the specification for improved security to the end user, and the wallet must confirm that the message is for the correct domain to avoid phishing attacks.
