The ERC-823: Token Exchange Standard is a proposed standard for token contracts on the Ethereum blockchain that would allow for token exchange services, making cross-token payments possible. This standard would enable ERC20 token holders to exchange their tokens with another ERC20 token and use the exchanged tokens to make payments. The exchanged tokens would be stored within the ERC20 token contract they are exchanged with, preserving them and increasing the market value of the latter. 

The motivation behind this proposal is that existing token standards do not provide functionality to exchange tokens, and existing token converters reduce the total supply of an existing token, which destroys the currency. Token converters do not solve this problem and discourage the creation of new tokens. The ERC-823 proposal aims to solve this problem by preserving the existing token in the token contract that they are exchanged with, increasing the market value of the latter.

The ERC-823 proposal includes a Sender Interface, which must be inherited by an ERC20 token contract that wants to exchange its tokens with another token. The interface includes storage variables such as exchangedWith, which stores the number of tokens exchanged with another token, along with the latterâs address, and exchangedBy, which stores the address of the person who initiated the exchange and the amount of tokens exchanged. The proposal also includes a method called exchangeToken, which allows for the exchange of tokens.

Overall, the ERC-823 proposal is an important step towards making cross-token payments possible on the Ethereum blockchain, and could have significant implications for the future of token exchange and the creation of new tokens.
