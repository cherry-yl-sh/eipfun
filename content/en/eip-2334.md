ERC-2334 is a standard that defines the purpose of a given key or family of keys within a tree of keys generated by EIP-2333. It provides a path that parses into the indices to be used when traversing the key tree. This standard is designed not only for Ethereum 2.0 but also for the wider community that has adopted BLS signatures over BLS12-381. The motivation behind this standard is the need for a new key derivation mechanism established within EIP-2333, which is incompatible with the current form of BIP44. The path structure specified in this EIP aims to be more general than BIP44 by not having UTXO-centric features, which gave rise to different types of wallet paths being used within Ethereum 1.0. This standard is intended to eventually migrate to a more neutral repository in the future.
