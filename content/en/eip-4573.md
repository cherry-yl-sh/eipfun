The EIP-4573 proposal introduces support for procedures in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Procedures are delimited blocks of code that can only be entered by calling into them via defined interfaces. This adds syntactic structure to Ethereum bytecode and allows for defined interfaces for subroutines. The proposal also includes automatic management of memory for procedures by reserving call frames on an in-memory stack. Constraints on the use of procedures must be validated at contract initialization time to maintain the safety properties of EIP-3779. The proposal introduces two new instructions: ENTERPROC and LEAVEPROC. ENTERPROC marks the entry point to a procedure and specifies the number of inputs, outputs, and locals to reserve in memory. Procedures can only be entered via a CALLPROC to their entry point. LEAVEPROC pops the frame stack and returns to the calling procedure using RETURNSUB. Overall, the proposal aims to improve the safety and efficiency of smart contract development on the Ethereum network.
