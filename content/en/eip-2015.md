The EIP-2015 proposal adds a new method to a wallet's web3 provider API called wallet_updateEthereumChain. This method is used to switch to a network and register it with the wallet if it isn't already recognized. It takes one parameter, an EthereumChainSwitchRequest object, which includes information about the chain being switched to. The method returns true if the chain was successfully added or switched to, and an error if the user rejected the request. The proposal also includes security considerations, such as sanitizing RPC URLs and storing a default list of commonly-used chains to avoid phishing attacks.
