## Summary

EIP-4758 proposes to deactivate the SELFDESTRUCT opcode in Ethereum programming languages. This opcode allows a contract to self-destruct and send its remaining funds to a designated address. However, it has been identified as a potential security risk and has been misused in the past. The proposal suggests replacing SELFDESTRUCT with a new opcode called SET_INDESTRUCTIBLE, which would prevent a contract from being destroyed. This would make contracts more secure and prevent accidental loss of funds. The proposal also includes a list of exceptions where SELFDESTRUCT can still be used, such as burning non-ETH token balances or making a contract upgradable. Overall, the goal of EIP-4758 is to improve the security and stability of the Ethereum ecosystem.
