The EIP-196 proposal suggests adding precompiled contracts for addition and scalar multiplication on the elliptic curve alt_bn128, which can be combined with EIP-197 to verify zkSNARKs in Ethereum smart contracts. The motivation behind this proposal is to increase privacy for users and potentially provide a scalability solution. The proposal includes specifications for the precompiled contracts, including their addresses and the curve they operate on, as well as test cases and implementation details.
