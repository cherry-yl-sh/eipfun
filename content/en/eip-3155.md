The EIP-3155 proposal aims to introduce a new JSON standard for EVM traces during execution of state tests in order to improve the debugging of smart contracts and state tests. It seeks to strictly define corner cases, allow for updates to the specification, and provide sample output. Implementing this proposal in all major clients would enable users to create better differential fuzzing infrastructure to compare the EVM implementations of all major Ethereum clients against each other, potentially helping to find bugs that are currently present in the client implementations.
