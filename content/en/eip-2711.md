EIP-2711 proposes a mechanism for allowing users to transact without owning any ETH by allowing someone else to cover gas costs. The arrangements for covering gas costs are out of scope for this EIP, but it could be done through a monthly subscription, payment as part of the transaction, or a free service offered by a company. The proposal separates GAS_PAYER from msg.sender at the protocol layer to make it easier to implement these mechanisms.nnThe proposal also includes support for batch transactions, which allows users to execute a series of transactions with a strong guarantee that they happen in order with nothing occurring between them. This ensures cross-transaction atomicity and provides strong guarantees at signing time.nnAdditionally, the proposal includes expiring transactions, which would remove the need to change nonce-behavior in the state. Transactions would not be replayable at a later date than explicitly set by the user, providing temporal replay protection. This would be useful during ICOs or other situations where users want their transactions to either become included soon or not at all.nnOverall, EIP-2711 aims to make transactions more user-friendly by allowing for sponsored transactions, providing support for batch transactions, and introducing expiring transactions for temporal replay protection.
