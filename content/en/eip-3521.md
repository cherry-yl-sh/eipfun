EIP-3521 proposes a reduction in the gas cost of access lists, which were introduced in EIP-2930 to mitigate the impact of gas cost increases on storage-accessing opcodes. The current gas cost of access lists is considered too high, making them less attractive for developers to use. The proposed reduction would make access lists more economically viable for applications that heavily rely on storage access. The reduction would be achieved by changing the way access lists are encoded and stored, which would result in a smaller size and lower gas cost. The proposed changes would not affect the functionality of access lists or their ability to mitigate contract breakage due to gas cost increases. The EIP also addresses potential security considerations, such as access list generation and transaction size bloating, and proposes solutions to mitigate these issues. Overall, EIP-3521 aims to improve the usability and effectiveness of access lists in mitigating the impact of gas cost increases on storage-accessing opcodes.
