ERC-6358 proposes a standard interface for synchronizing token states across multiple public blockchains. The goal is to create a global token protocol that can be inherited from ERC-20/ERC-721 over multiple chains. The synchronization is achieved through trustless off-chain synchronizers, which record the token states synchronously on smart contracts or similar mechanisms on existing blockchains. The key motivation behind this proposal is to solve the problem of asset fragmentation caused by the current paradigm of token bridges. If a chain breaks down, assets transferred through the current token bridge can be lost for users. However, with the proposed synchronization paradigm, even if all other chains break down, as long as Ethereum is still running, users' assets will not be lost. The proposal aims to enhance the security of users' multi-chain assets. The proposal includes an Omniverse Account data structure and a smart contract interface. The proposal is currently in the process of being peer-reviewed, and interested parties can participate in the discussion using the provided link.
