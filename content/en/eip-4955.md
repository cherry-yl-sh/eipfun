The ERC-4955 proposal is for a standardized schema for NFT metadata that adds new field namespaces to the JSON schema for EIP-721 and EIP-1155 NFTs. The motivation behind this proposal is to allow wallets, marketplaces, metaverses, and similar applications to interoperate with any NFT. The proposal introduces a new property called namespaces, which expects one object per project. This allows projects like Decentraland, TheSandbox, Cryptoavatars, etc. to have their own 3D model to represent an NFT, which is not cross-compatible due to distinct aesthetics and data formats. The idea behind extending the EIP-721 metadata schema is for backward compatibility, as most projects on Ethereum use non-upgradeable contracts. The JSON metadata is already used to store representations using the image field, so it seems reasonable to have all the representations of an asset in the same place. Existing projects that can't modify the metadata response (schema) may be able to create a new smart contract that, based on the tokenId, returns the updated metadata schema. The same security considerations as with EIP-721 apply related to using http gateways or IPFS for the tokenURI method. The proposal is available on the Ethereum Improvement Proposals website and can be cited as ERC-4955.
