EIP-3044 is a proposal to add a new field called `baseFee` to the `eth_getBlockByNumber` endpoint in Ethereum. This field provides information about the minimum fee required to include a transaction in a block. The proposal was made in October 2020 and is considered to be backwards compatible, meaning that it does not affect calls related to blocks prior to the EIP-1559 fork block. The proposal was made by Abdelhamid Bakhta and is considered to be informational and not introducing any technical security issues.

The addition of the `baseFee` field was seen as a simple change that would be easy to integrate, and it was decided to not include the base fee in the response for pre-1559 blocks for backward compatibility. The proposal is related to the EIP-1559 proposal, which introduced a new fee market mechanism to Ethereum and aimed to improve the user experience by making transaction fees more predictable and reducing network congestion.
