The EIP-211 proposal introduces two new opcodes, RETURNDATASIZE and RETURNDATACOPY, which allow for returning arbitrary-length data inside the EVM. This solves the problem of returning data whose length cannot be anticipated before the call, which was previously very expensive to do. The proposal has a simple gas charging mechanism and requires minimal changes to the call opcodes. The workings of the new opcodes are similar to the way calldata is handled already. After a call, return data is kept inside a virtual buffer from which the caller can copy it (or parts thereof) into memory. At the next call, the buffer is overwritten. This mechanism is 100% backwards compatible.
