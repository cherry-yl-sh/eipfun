The ERC-2767 proposal is a standard for Governance contracts that holds the administrative ownership of other smart contracts with voting power distributed as ERC-20 tokens. It aims to improve the governance of contract ownership in the Ethereum ecosystem by standardizing the API of Governance contracts, encouraging the use of ERC-20 based weighted governance, and making it easy for analysis tools to be built. It also encourages existing ERC-173 ownership smart contracts/projects to move to Governance based ownership and make publicly audited governance contracts available.
