The EIP-3298 proposal suggests the complete removal of refunds in the Ethereum network. Refunds are currently given to users when they perform certain actions, such as deleting data from the blockchain. However, this creates a lot of complexity and can lead to security vulnerabilities. The proposal argues that removing refunds will simplify the codebase and make the network more secure. It also suggests that the gas limit be increased to compensate for the removal of refunds. The proposal has not yet been implemented and is still in the draft stage.
