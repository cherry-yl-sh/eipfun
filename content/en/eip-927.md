The ERC-927 standard proposes a generic authorisation mechanism that can be used to implement various authorisation patterns in smart contracts. This mechanism replaces approvals in ERC20, operators in ERC777, and bespoke authorisation patterns in other types of contracts. The motivation behind this standard is to provide a standardised method for third-party callers to perform actions on behalf of a user in smart contracts. This is a common requirement in the ecosystem, and each standard typically reinvents the system for themselves, leading to a large number of incompatible implementations of the same basic pattern. 

The generalised authorisation interface is implemented as a metadata provider, as specified in EIP 926. The interface includes a mandatory function called canCall, which takes in the owner address, caller address, callee address, and function signature as parameters. If the function returns false, the callee reverts execution. 

The standard is inspired by ds-auth and OAuth, and it uses EIP 926 for the authorisation flow. The callee contract fetches the provider for the owner address from the metadata registry contract, which resides at a well-known address. Then, the callee contract calls canCall() with the parameters described above. If the function returns true, the callee contract can perform the action on behalf of the owner. 

In summary, ERC-927 provides a standardised method for implementing authorisation patterns in smart contracts. It replaces the need for bespoke authorisation patterns in various types of contracts and provides a generic method usable by all such contracts. The standard is implemented as a metadata provider and includes a mandatory function called canCall, which takes in the necessary parameters for authorisation. The standard is inspired by ds-auth and OAuth and uses EIP 926 for the authorisation flow.
