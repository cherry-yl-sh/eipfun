The ERC-1202 is a proposed standard for implementing voting with smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides a set of functionalities for voting, viewing vote results, and setting voting status. The motivation behind this standard is to enable more decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to leverage voting as a key part of their governance process. By creating a standardized voting interface, it allows for general UI and applications to be built on top of it, encourages more DApps and DAOs to think about their governance, and allows for interoperability within the Ethereum ecosystem and other systems. The standard also allows for delegate voting, automatic voting, and recording voting results on-chain in a standard way. It can be compatible with other token standards such as EIP-20 and item standards such as EIP-721. The standard also considers potential issues of abuse, such as bribery and conflict of interest, and suggests ways to address them. Overall, the ERC-1202 aims to provide a flexible and secure way for DAOs and DApps to implement voting on-chain.
