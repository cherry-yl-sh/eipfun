## Summary

EIP-1052 proposes a new opcode, EXTCODEHASH, which returns the keccak256 hash of a contract's bytecode. This opcode is useful for contracts that need to perform checks on a contract's bytecode but do not necessarily need the bytecode itself. For instance, a contract may want to check if another contract's bytecode is one of a set of permitted implementations or perform analyses on code and whitelist any contract with matching bytecode if the analysis passes. 

The EXTCODEHASH opcode takes one argument from the stack, zeros the first 96 bits, and pushes to the stack the keccak256 hash of the code of the account at the address being the remaining 160 bits. In case the account does not exist or is empty, 0 is pushed to the stack. In case the account does not have code, the keccak256 hash of empty data is pushed to the stack. The gas cost of the EXTCODEHASH is 400, which is the same as the gas cost for the BALANCE opcode because the execution of the EXTCODEHASH requires the same account lookup as in BALANCE. 

The EXTCODEHASH opcode distinguishes accounts without code and non-existing accounts, which is consistent with the way accounts are represented in the state trie. This also allows smart contracts to check whether an account exists. There are no backwards compatibility concerns with this opcode. Test cases are provided to ensure the correct implementation of the opcode. The implementation of the opcode is yet to be determined.
