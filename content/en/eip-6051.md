The EIP-6051 proposal defines a specification for encapsulating private keys so that they can be securely relocated to another application without providing the seed. It combines ECIES and optional signature verification to ensure that the private key is encapsulated for a known or trusted party. The motivation behind this proposal is to enable use cases where one might want to export one of many private keys from a much more secure but less convenient wallet, without providing the seed which controls the whole wallet and might contain many addresses in multiple chains.
