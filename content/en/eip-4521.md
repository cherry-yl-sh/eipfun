The ERC-4521 proposal suggests a simple extension to the ERC-721 standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to make them compatible with contracts and apps that handle fungible ERC-20 tokens. Specifically, it proposes adding a backwards-compatible transfer() function to ERC-721, which would allow NFTs to work with contracts designed to manage ERC-20s and consumer wallets that expect to be able to execute a token transfer(). The interface for ERC-4521 transfer() must conform to ERC-20, and resulting transfers must fire the Transfer event as described in ERC-721. The proposal aims to simplify the task for contract programmers and make integration easier by replicating ERC-20 transfer() with a minor change to reflect that a unique tokenId rather than a fungible sum is being sent. Implementers must include the relevant return bool value for an ERC-4521 to conform with existing contracts that use ERC-20 interfaces, otherwise, NFTs may be locked unless a safeTransfer is used in such contracts. The proposal does not introduce any known backward compatibility issues and provides a reference implementation of an ERC-4521 transfer().
