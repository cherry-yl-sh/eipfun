The EIP-3455 proposal introduces a new opcode called SUDO, which allows calling from an arbitrary sender address. It has the same parameters as CALL, plus an additional parameter to specify the sender address. The motivation behind this proposal is to address various use cases, such as recovering tokens stuck in an address with no key, recovering tokens sent to the wrong address, recovering funds lost due to scams or lost private keys, and unlocking tokens and ether locked in smart contracts due to bugs. The specification adds the SUDO opcode at 0xf8 and specifies that it pops 8 parameters from the stack, with the sender parameter being the additional parameter.
