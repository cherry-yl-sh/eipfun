EIP-4788 proposes to expose the roots of beacon chain blocks in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to allow for trust-minimized access to the consensus layer. The roots of beacon chain blocks are cryptographic accumulators that allow for proofs of arbitrary consensus state. By exposing these roots in the EVM, a wide variety of use cases can be supported, including improving trust assumptions of staking pools, restaking constructions, smart contract bridges, and mitigating miner extractable value (MEV). The proposal suggests committing to the hash tree root of each beacon chain block in the corresponding execution payload header and storing each of these roots in a stateful precompile. To bound the amount of storage this construction consumes, a ring buffer is used that mirrors a block root accumulator on the consensus layer. The proposal also includes specifications for FORK_TIMESTAMP, HISTORY_STORAGE_ADDRESS, and G_beacon_root gas. The proposal is still in draft form and has not yet been implemented.
