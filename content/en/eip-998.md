ERC-998 is an extension of the ERC-721 standard that allows ERC-721 tokens to own other ERC-721 and ERC-20 tokens. It also extends the ERC-20 and ERC-223 standards to allow ERC-20 and ERC-223 tokens to be owned by ERC-721 tokens. There are four different kinds of composable tokens: ERC998ERC721 top-down composable tokens, ERC998ERC20 top-down composable tokens, ERC998ERC721 bottom-up composable tokens, and ERC998ERC20 bottom-up composable tokens. Each kind has its own specifications and advantages/disadvantages, which are explained in the Rationale section of the specification. Composable tokens allow for the creation of lists or trees of tokens connected by ownership, with a single owner address at the root of the structure. The entire composition can be transferred with one transaction by changing the root owner.
