ERC-1844 is a proposed Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) that defines a method of associating contract interfaces with ENS names and addresses, and of discovering those interfaces. It specifies a method for exposing interfaces associated with an ENS name or an address (typically a contract address) and allowing applications to discover those interfaces and interact with them. Interfaces can be implemented either by the target contract (if any) or by any other contract. 

The motivation behind ERC-1844 is to provide a way to discover functionality associated with a name or an address that is implemented by other contracts. For example, a token contract may not itself provide any kind of âatomic swapâ functionality, but there may be associated contracts that do. With ENS interface discovery, the token contract can expose this metadata, informing applications where they can find that functionality.

To achieve this, a new profile for ENS resolvers is defined, consisting of the function "interfaceImplementer". Given an ENS name hash node and an EIP-165 interfaceID, this function returns the address of an appropriate implementer of that interface. If there is no interface matching that interface ID for that node, 0 is returned. The address returned by interfaceImplementer must refer to a smart contract and the smart contract at the returned address should implement EIP-165.

Overall, ERC-1844 aims to enhance the functionality and usability of the Ethereum Name Service by allowing for the discovery of contract interfaces associated with ENS names and addresses.
