## Summary

ERC-3440 is a proposal to extend the ERC-721 specification for NFTs representing works of art. It allows for signatures on NFTs, providing improved provenance and allowing artists to designate an original and signed limited-edition prints of their work. The proposal creates a specialized enumeration extension similar to the original ERC-721 extension built-in, which allows artists to designate the limited nature of their prints and provide a signed piece of data that represents their unique signature to a given token Id, much like an artist would sign a print of their work. The key improvement of this extension is allowing artists to maintain a connection with the Ethereum blockchain as well as their fans that purchase their tokens. By making a concise standard for art, it will be easier for an artist to maintain a connection with the Ethereum blockchain as well as their fans that purchase their tokens. The proposal helps remove the distance between the NFT, digital art, owner, and artist by providing readily available functionality for artists to sign their work and provides a standard for 3rd party applications to display the uniqueness of a NFT for those that purchase them. The designation of limited-editions combined with immutable signatures creates a trustlessly enforced link. ERC-721 compliant contracts may implement this ERC for editions to provide a standard method for designating the original and limited-edition prints with signatures from the artist.
