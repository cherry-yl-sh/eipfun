EIP-2124 proposes a new identity scheme to identify whether a node will be useful in the Ethereum network, as early as possible. Currently, nodes try to find each other by establishing random connections to remote machines, which wastes time and resources. The proposal defines a fork identifier that can precisely summarize chain configurations and disseminate said summaries in the network. This will allow for the identification of good or bad peers, same chain or not, without the need for establishing a TCP/IP connection and executing an eth handshake. The proposal also addresses the issue of stale nodes during non-controversial consensus upgrades, which put a meaningless burden on the peer-to-peer network. The proposal aims to extract more value from public nodes and make the entire P2P network more robust and reliable by cutting off incompatible nodes from each other. The proposal defines the identity scheme and validation rules, which can be embedded into various networking protocols, allowing for more precise eth/6x handshake and more useful discovery. Each node maintains the FORK_HASH value, which is an IEEE CRC32 checksum of the genesis hash and fork blocks numbers that already passed.
