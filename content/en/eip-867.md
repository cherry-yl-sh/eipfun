EIP-867 is a proposal for standardized Ethereum Recovery Proposals (ERPs) that aim to address certain classes of lost funds on the Ethereum blockchain. The proposal provides a common solution method that can be used to recover lost funds in cases where there is no disagreement about the right outcome between directly affected parties. The proposal is intended to enable timely and low-risk solutions to many issues that have already occurred or are likely to occur again as Ethereum grows.

The proposal is divided into three parts: standards that will need to be met by any follow-on ERP in order to be considered for approval, recommendations for a common format for ERPs to use to specify a set of corrective actions that can be interpreted by clients, and guidelines for client teams to implement code that can read, interpret, and apply the corrective actions at a specific block.

Each ERP will be required to use a standard format to represent the set of proposed state changes and must include a verification script that can reliably generate those changes. ERPs that do not meet these requirements will not be considered for approval.

The proposal does not advocate for or against the acceptance of any particular recovery proposals, nor would its acceptance alone result in any state changes to the blockchain. The proposal attempts to remove barriers to frozen fund recovery proposals by providing both a standardized format for fund recovery EIPs and an objective standard by which to measure future proposals.

In summary, EIP-867 is a proposal for standardized Ethereum Recovery Proposals that aim to provide a common solution method to recover lost funds on the Ethereum blockchain. The proposal provides guidelines for the format and content of ERPs and guidelines for client teams to implement code that can read, interpret, and apply the corrective actions at a specific block.
