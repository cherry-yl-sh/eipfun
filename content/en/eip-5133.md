EIP-5133, titled "Delaying Difficulty Bomb to mid-September 2022," proposes a delay to the Ethereum difficulty bomb by an additional 700,000 blocks, which is expected to push the activation to mid-September 2022. The difficulty bomb, also known as the "Ice Age," is a mechanism that, if activated, would increase the difficulty of mining new blocks over time until it becomes infeasible, effectively leading to a halt in block production.

The proposal aims to prevent network degradation due to a premature activation of the difficulty bomb. It suggests a modification in the calculation of block difficulty, replacing the use of the actual block number with a "fake" block number that indicates the difficulty bomb is adjusting 11,400,000 blocks later than the actual block number.

The document includes a script to predict the block number at which the difficulty bomb will become noticeable. It anticipates 0.1s delays by mid-September and 0.6-1.2s delays by early October. The proposal also acknowledges potential security considerations, including the risk of misjudging the effects of the difficulty bomb, which could lead to longer block times than anticipated until a hard fork is released. It also notes the possibility of a significant drop in network hash rate before The Merge, which could accelerate the timeline by which the bomb is felt in block times.
