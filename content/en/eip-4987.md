The ERC-4987 proposal defines a standard interface for smart contracts to expose ownership and balance information of held tokens, which are tokens owned by a contract. This interface can be implemented by contracts holding EIP-20, EIP-721, or EIP-1155 tokens and can be used by both on-chain and off-chain systems for ownership and balance verification. The motivation behind this proposal is to address conflicts between mechanisms that require token deposits and systems that rely on those tokens for ownership or balance verification, allowing users to participate in DeFi mechanisms without giving up existing token utility. The proposal specifies that smart contracts implementing the ERC20 held token standard must implement all functions in the IERC20Holder interface and must also implement ERC165 and return true when the interface ID 0x74c89d54 is passed. Example implementers of this standard include staking or farming contracts, lending pools, time lock or vesting vaults, fractionalized NFT contracts, and smart contract wallets, while example consumers include governance systems, gaming, PFP verification, art galleries or showcases, and token-based membership programs.
