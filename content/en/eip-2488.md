## Summary

EIP-2488 proposes to deprecate the CALLCODE opcode in Ethereum by making it always return failure in a backwards compatible way. The rationale is that CALLCODE was never utilized and puts a burden on EVM implementations, and disabling it would help light clients or clients planning to sync from a later point in time. This is a breaking change with the potential to break contracts, but the author expects no contracts of any value should be affected.
