## Summary

ERC-162 is a proposal for the implementation of a registrar contract to govern the allocation of names in the Ethereum Name Service (ENS). Registrars are responsible for allocating domain names to users of the system, and are the only entities capable of updating the ENS. The proposal suggests starting with a temporary registrar and not committing to a permanent registrar at the outset. Valid names must be at least 7 characters long and the top-level domain (TLD) is restricted to .eth. Names will be auctioned off and the winning bidder will need to hold ether as collateral. The proposal also outlines the deployment and upgrade process, as well as the planned deactivation of the registrar. The document borrows heavily from several sources, including EIP-137, which outlines the initial implementation of the Registry Contract and associated Resolver contracts, and ERC-26, which was the first ERC to propose a name service at the contract layer. The proposal was deployed to the main Ethereum network on May 4, 2017.
