EIP-2384 proposes to delay the difficulty bomb in Ethereum for another 4,000,000 blocks (~611 days) by calculating the difficulty based on a fake block number. This is necessary because the difficulty bomb is causing block times to increase and will eventually make the chain bloated and more costly to use. The delay will push the ice age 4,000,000 blocks from ~block 8,800,000 NOT from when this EIP is activated in a fork.
