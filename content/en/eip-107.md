The EIP-107 proposal aims to provide a safe and secure method for regular websites to send transactions via the "eth_sendTransaction" function without the need to enable CORS. Currently, if a user navigates to a dapp running on a website using their everyday browser, the dapp will not have access to the rpc api for security reasons. The user would have to enable CORS for the website's domain in order for the dapp to work. However, if the user does so, the dapp will be able to send transactions from any unlocked account without the need for any user consent. This is not acceptable as it forces the user to trust the dapp and change the node's default setting. nnThe proposed solution is to present an HTML popup to the user for every transaction that the dapp wishes to execute. The user can then cancel or confirm the transaction, allowing the dapp to connect to the node's rpc api without being granted any kind of privileges. This allows users to safely interact with dapps running in their everyday web browser while their accounts are unlocked. nnIf the account is not unlocked, and the node has allowed the "personal" api via rpc, the HTML page also allows the user to enter their password to unlock the account for the scope of the transaction. This ensures that the user has complete control over their account and can authorize transactions only when they want to. nnOverall, the EIP-107 proposal aims to provide a secure and user-friendly method for regular websites to interact with the Ethereum network without compromising the security of the user's account. By presenting an HTML popup for every transaction, the user can have complete control over their account and authorize transactions only when they want to.
