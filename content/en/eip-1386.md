## Summary

ERC-1386 proposes an interface for attestation issuers to manage their attestation signing keys and the attestations that are issued off-chain for actions such as revocation and validation. The proposal includes functions to hold cryptographic attestations, change the issuing contracts of attestations, revoke attestations, and verify the authenticity of a cryptographic attestation. The purpose of this proposal is to enable the use of attestations on the blockchain that are issued by a valid issuer off-chain for privacy reasons and can be revoked inside a smart contract. The proposal also allows each attestor to update their attestation format separately. An example use case is provided where a person uses a cryptographic attestation from their local road and maritime services to prove their age and ability to buy alcohol online. The attestation is split up using a merkle tree attestation and only the necessary information is provided to the wine vendor's smart contract to complete the purchase.
