## Summary

The purpose of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) is to propose new features, collect technical input from the community, and document design decisions for Ethereum. EIPs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, and their revision history serves as the historical record of the feature proposal. EIPs should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for it, and the author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions. There are three types of EIPs, and they have specific requirements and guidelines for formatting, linking to external resources, and transferring ownership. EIPs are also a convenient way for Ethereum implementers to track the progress of their implementation and for end users to know the current status of a given implementation or library.
