The proposed ERC-6823 is a method for obtaining the reserved storage slot of the mapping responsible for tracking ownership of compliant tokens in ERC-20, ERC-721, or ERC-1155 contracts. This aims to enhance the precision of off-chain simulations for transactions involving these contracts by offering a standardized entry point for identifying the reserved storage slot of a mapping in a compatible manner. This allows for capturing state changes more precisely and enables external tools and services to do so without requiring expertise in the particular implementation details.
