The ERC-4341 is a proposed standard for a smart contract interface that can represent a batch of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) while retaining and managing the ordering information of those tokens. This is particularly useful for NFTs that are encoded with sets of unicodes for logographic characters and emojis, as they can be utilized as carriers of meanings. The standard proposes that NFTs can be thought of as basic units on a blockchain that can carry abstract meanings with unicoded tokenIds. By transferring such tokens, an ordered sequence of unicodes can be transmitted, effectively transmitting phrases or meanings on a blockchain. The standard proposes the use of unicoded NFTs to represent logographic characters, as a rich amount of meanings can be transmitted in just a few characters in such languages. Emojis can also be included. However, for non-logographic languages such as English, it may not be practical to represent each letter with an NFT. The ERC-4341 is a new standard that builds on previous NFT standards such as ERC-721 and ERC-1155, which discard the ordering information of multiple NFTs. The proposed standard is still in draft form and has not been officially adopted.
