## Summary

The ERC-5380 proposal suggests a new interface that allows ERC-721 token owners to grant limited usage of those tokens to other addresses. This can be useful in scenarios such as renting tokens or granting usage rights to associated media. The proposal also includes a specification for creating a more tangible link between NFTs, digital art, owners, and artists. It provides a standard for 3rd party applications to display the uniqueness of an NFT for those that purchase them, by designating limited-editions combined with immutable signatures that create a trustlessly enforced link. ERC-721 compliant contracts may implement this ERC for editions to provide a standard method for designating the original and limited-edition prints with signatures from the artist. Overall, the proposal aims to make it easier for artists to maintain a connection with the Ethereum blockchain and their fans that purchase their tokens.
