EIP-3300 proposes to phase out refunds in Ethereum. Refunds are currently given to users when they execute certain operations that free up storage space on the blockchain. However, this creates inefficiencies and can lead to abuse. The proposal suggests that instead of refunds, gas costs should be reduced for these operations. This would simplify the gas cost model and reduce the risk of abuse. The proposal also suggests that clients should not perform storage writes if the new value is the same as the original value, as this is an unnecessary operation. Overall, the proposal aims to improve the efficiency and security of the Ethereum blockchain.
