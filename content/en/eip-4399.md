## Summary

EIP-4399 proposes to replace the semantics of the DIFFICULTY opcode with the PREVRANDAO opcode in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This change will allow smart contracts to access the randomness accumulated by the beacon chain, which is used in the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. The return value of the PREVRANDAO opcode will be the output of the randomness beacon provided by the beacon chain. This change is backward compatible for existing smart contracts that obtain randomness from the DIFFICULTY opcode. However, it may be backward incompatible for applications that use the value returned by the DIFFICULTY opcode as the Proof of Work (PoW) difficulty parameter or applications with logic that depends on the DIFFICULTY opcode returning a relatively small number with respect to the full 256-bit size of the field. The proposed change is tightly coupled with the PoS upgrade introduced in EIP-3675 and must be scheduled at the same time. The PREVRANDAO opcode is a source of randomness with different properties to the randomness supplied by BLOCKHASH or DIFFICULTY opcodes in the PoW network. The beacon chain RANDAO implementation gives every block proposer 1 bit of influence power per slot, which may introduce biasability.
