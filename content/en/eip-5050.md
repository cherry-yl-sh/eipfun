## Summary

The ERC-5050 proposal defines a standard action messaging protocol for the transmission of user-initiated actions between tokens, allowing for interactivity and "digital physics" to be built into NFTs. It also includes optional state controller contracts (environments) that manage shared state and provide arbitration and settlement of the action process. The protocol outlines how an action is initiated and transmitted between tokens and shared state environments, and is paired with a common interface for defining functionality that allows off-chain services to aggregate and query supported contracts for functionality and interoperability. This creates a discoverable, human-readable network of interactive token contracts, allowing clients to easily discover compatible senders and receivers and allowed actions. Aggregators can also parse action event logs to derive analytics on new action types, trending/popular/new interactive contracts, and other discovery tools to facilitate interaction. The proposal aims to provide a standard for works of digital art, such as digital art and music, by creating a more tangible link between the NFT, digital art, owner, and artist. It allows for the designation of original NFTs and printed editions with signatures in a trustless manner, providing readily available functionality for artists to sign their work and a standard for 3rd party applications to display the uniqueness of an NFT for those that purchase them. ERC-721 compliant contracts may implement this ERC for editions to provide a standard method for designating the original and limited-edition prints with signatures from the artist.
