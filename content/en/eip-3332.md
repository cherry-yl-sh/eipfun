EIP-3332 proposes adding a new opcode, MEDGASPRICE (0x46), which returns the median gas price of the parent block. The motivation behind this proposal is to provide a mechanism for enforcing an upper bound on gas prices for transactions, which can be effective in defending against front-running attacks. This opcode can also be used by smart contracts to set a maximum gas price as a function of the last blocks gas price. However, there are some caveats to this strategy, such as the fluctuation of gas prices and the need for miners to be impartial.
