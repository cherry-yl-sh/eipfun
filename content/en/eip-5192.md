## Summary

The ERC-5192 proposal is an extension of the EIP-721 standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain. It proposes a minimal interface for making tokens "soulbound," meaning they are non-transferrable and bound to a single account. The motivation for this proposal is to provide a standard for socially-priced tokens similar to World of Warcraft's soulbound items, which are non-transferrable and have a personal connection to the owner. The proposal outlines a contract interface for binding a token to a receiving account and specifies that all EIP-721 functions that transfer the token from one account to another must throw. The proposal also includes considerations for backwards compatibility and security. In summary, the ERC-5192 proposal aims to provide a standard for creating soulbound NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain.
