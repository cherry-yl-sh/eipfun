EIP-3855 proposes the introduction of a new instruction, PUSH0 (0x5f), which pushes the constant value 0 onto the stack in Ethereum bytecode. The motivation for this change is to reduce contract code size, reduce the risk of contracts misusing various instructions as an optimization measure, and reduce the need to use DUP instructions for duplicating zeroes. The cost of this instruction is 2 gas, and there are no known security considerations.
