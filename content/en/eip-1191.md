The ERC-1191 proposal extends the EIP-55 checksum algorithm by optionally adding a chain id defined by EIP-155 to the checksum calculation. This allows software to distinguish addresses from different Ethereum based networks and protects users from losing funds by sending them to addresses that are valid but obtained from a client of another network. The proposal includes a specification for converting the address using the same algorithm defined by EIP-55 but with the addition of a registered chain id. The proposal also discusses potential scenarios where a community using a particular value of chain ID may split into two chains and the need for users of the proposed CHAINID opcode to ensure their application can handle a potential update to the value of chain ID.
