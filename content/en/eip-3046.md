## Summary

EIP-3046 proposes adding a new field called `baseFee` to the `eth_getUncleByBlockNumberAndIndex` endpoint in Ethereum. This field is informational and does not introduce any technical security issues. The proposal is backwards compatible, meaning that calls related to blocks prior to the EIP-1559 fork block will omit the `baseFee` field in the response. The addition of this field is intended to support the EIP-1559 proposal, which aims to improve the efficiency and user experience of the Ethereum network by introducing a new transaction pricing mechanism. The `baseFee` field will be used to calculate the maximum fee that can be paid for a transaction, and will be adjusted dynamically based on network demand. Overall, the proposal is a small but important step towards improving the functionality and usability of the Ethereum network.
