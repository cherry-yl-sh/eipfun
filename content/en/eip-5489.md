## Summary

ERC-5489 proposes a new extension for NFTs (non-fungible tokens) called the NFT Hyperlink Extension, which allows users to embed hyperlinks onto NFTs, referred to as "hNFTs". This enables users to click on any hNFT and be transported to any URL set by the owner. As owners of hNFTs, users may authorize a URL slot to a specific address, which can be either an externally-owned account (EOA) or a contract address, and hNFT owners are entitled to revoke that authorization at any time. The address which has slot authorization can manage the URL of that slot. 

The motivation behind this proposal is that as NFTs become more popular, they have the potential to become the primary medium of Web3. However, currently, end-users cannot attach rich texts, videos, or images to NFTs, and there is no way to render these rich-content attachments. This proposal uses hyperlinks as a form of "highly customized attachment on NFT" and specifies how to attach, edit, and display these attachments on NFTs. 

The proposal includes a specification that outlines the key words and their interpretations, as well as an interface that allows for authentication and a metadata JSON schema. The proposal also includes a rationale for extending NFTs with hyperlinks and authorizing slots to addresses, as well as considerations for backwards compatibility, security, and copyright. Overall, ERC-5489 aims to standardize the process of attaching, editing, and displaying highly customized information on NFTs through the use of hyperlinks.
