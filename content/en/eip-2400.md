## Summary

The ERC-2400 proposal outlines a standard format for transaction receipt URIs in Ethereum, which includes all necessary information for displaying a transaction and its details, such as chainId, method signature called, and events signatures emitted. This allows for interoperability between Ethereum clients and provides a standardized way of representing submitted transaction hashes with necessary information for decoding transaction details. The syntax for the URI includes a standard ABI type name and a URL-encoded unicode string of arbitrary length. The proposal also includes examples and rationale for the standard.
