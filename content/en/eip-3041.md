EIP-3041 is a proposal to add a new parameter called `baseFee` to the `eth_getBlockByHash` endpoint in Ethereum. This parameter is used to determine the minimum fee required for a transaction to be included in a block. The `baseFee` amount is adjusted up or down based on network congestion, with the goal of keeping the network operating at a target capacity. This allows wallets to automatically set gas fees for users in a reliable way, without the need for complex fee estimation algorithms. The `baseFee` is always burned, meaning it is destroyed by the protocol, and only the priority fee is paid to miners. This ensures that only ETH can be used to pay for transactions on Ethereum, and reduces the risk of miner extractable value (MEV). EIP-3041 is backwards compatible, meaning it will not affect calls related to blocks prior to the EIP-1559 fork block, and it does not introduce any technical security issues.
