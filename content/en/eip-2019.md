The ERC-2021 proposal suggests creating a semi-fungible token that combines the quantitative features of ERC-20 tokens with the qualitative attributes of ERC-721 tokens. This would solve the drawbacks of both types of tokens, as ERC-20 tokens require creating a separate contract for each data structure and ERC-721 tokens lack quantitative features. The proposal recommends implementing the ERC-3525, ERC-721, and ERC-165 interfaces and using scientific notation to display the amount of tokens transacted. The goal is to create a more intuitive and straightforward way to use and control digital assets in crypto, leading to faster adoption.
