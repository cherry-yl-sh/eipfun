The ERC-5604 proposal introduces NFT liens, which are a form of security interest over an NFT to secure the recovery of liability or performance of some other obligation. This proposal provides an interface to place and remove a lien, as well as an event to be emitted when a new lien is successfully placed. Any compliant contract must implement EIP-721 and EIP-165, and the IERC_LIEN interface. The motivation behind this proposal is to provide a way to use liens for finance use cases with NFTs, such as for a deed.
