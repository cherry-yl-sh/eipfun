The ERC-5507 proposal adds refund functionality to ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155 tokens for initial token offerings. This means that funds are held in escrow until a predetermined time before they are claimable, and until that time passes, users can receive a refund for tokens they have purchased. The motivation behind this proposal is to provide greater protection for buyers and increase legitimacy for creators in the NFT and token spaces, which currently lack accountability. A standard interface for this use case allows for greater compliance with EU regulations, interoperability with various NFT-related applications, and better wallet confirmation dialogs. The proposal is backwards compatible and includes security considerations. Two related proposals, ERC-6909 and ERC-4393, are also mentioned in the specification.
