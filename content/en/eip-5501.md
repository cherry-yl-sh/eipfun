## Summary

The ERC-5501 proposal is an extension to the EIP-721 standard for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) that aims to efficiently manage privileges attached to NFTs in real-time. It adds a conditional time-limited user role to EIP-721, which can be delegated or borrowed. This role grants permission to use the NFT with no ability to transfer or set users, and has an expiry and a flag if the token is borrowed or not. The owner can delegate the NFT for usage to hot wallets or lend the NFT, and if the token is borrowed, not even the owner can change the user until the status expires or both parties agree to terminate. This way, it is possible to keep both roles active at the same time. The proposal also includes interfaces to manage different privileges that an NFT collection may have, allowing users to transfer or sell privileges without losing their ownership of the NFT. This facilitates a great possibility for NFTs to have real usefulness, such as a fashion store giving a discount for its own NFT holders, a DAO member NFT holder voting for the proposal of how to use their treasury, or a grocery store issuing its membership card on-chain (as an NFT) and giving certain privileges when the members shop at grocery stores. Overall, the ERC-5501 proposal aims to make NFTs more versatile and useful in different scenarios.
