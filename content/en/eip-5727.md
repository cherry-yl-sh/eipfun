ERC-5727 proposes a new token interface for semi-fungible soulbound tokens (SBTs) that can differentiate between similar tokens. SBTs are bound to an address and represent the identity of the address, and each recovery should be considered as a transfer of all the tokens of the owner. The proposal is compatible with ERC-721, ERC-3525, ERC-4906, ERC-5192, ERC-5484, and ERC-165. The proposal includes test cases and a reference implementation. Users should be aware of the security risks of using the recovery mechanism and keep their private keys safe. The proposal waives copyright and related rights via CC0 and should be cited as "ERC-5727: Semi-Fungible Soulbound Token [DRAFT]."
