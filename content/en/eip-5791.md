The ERC-5791 proposal suggests a system for creating non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that are tied to physical assets. The proposal builds on the existing EIP-721 NFT standard and includes a user management mechanism that does not affect token ownership. The physical asset generates a random Ethereum address that only the asset knows, preventing identity theft and proving the asset's authenticity. Only the asset manufacturer should be able to create the associated token, and assets should reconstruct their secrets from non-sensitive information to avoid storing secrets. The proposal also suggests a secure key exchange protocol based on elliptic curves but allows for coexistence with other key exchange methods. The proposal does not address the security of the physical chip, which is outside its scope.
