ERC-5247 proposes an interface for creating and executing proposals on the blockchain. These proposals can include information about function calls, target contract addresses, ether values, gas limits, and calldatas. The proposal can be submitted, recorded, and possibly executed on-chain. This interface can be useful in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), bilateral collaborations, and making offers with conditions. The proposal is first composed, discussed, and approved before being executed. The proposal can be endorsed and voted on by members before consensus is formed. The proposal interface includes a reference implementation and security considerations that need further discussion.
