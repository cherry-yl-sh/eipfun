The ERC-6809 proposal is for a standard interface for Non-Fungible Key Bound Tokens (NFKBTs) in Ethereum. NFKBTs are a subset of Key Bound Tokens (KBTs) and provide additional security to non-fungible assets on a self-custodial level. The proposal includes an addBindings function that designates allowTransfer and allowApproval functions, which are called by one of the ERC-721 functions. The proposal also includes specifications for the IKBT721 token contract, events, and interface functions. The motivation for the proposal is to consider the target demographic of all ages and backgrounds for global adoption of self-custodial assets. The proposal addresses the issue of individual responsibility for securing assets and the potential loss of funds due to mistakes. The proposal references other related proposals, such as ERC-1948 for Non-fungible Data Tokens and ERC-6909 for Minimal Multi-Token Interface.
