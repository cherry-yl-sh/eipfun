The EIP-2583 proposal introduces a gas penalty for opcodes which access the account for trie non-existent accounts in Ethereum. This penalty is added to prevent DoS attacks, as non-existing accounts can bypass cache mechanisms and create a large discrepancy between normal and worst-case execution of an opcode. The proposal determines the penalty and provides alternative variants, such as insta-refunds and parent bail. It requires a hard-fork for implementation and does not affect regular transactions with value. The proposal also addresses layer-2 backward compatibility and scenarios such as Solidity remote calls and ERC223 Token Standard.
