The EIP-6810 proposal for Ex Post Facto Cascading Revert in Ethereum introduces a new transaction type that allows for the reversal of a sender's prior transactions and any transactions dependent on that state, recursively. This feature is intended to address common mistakes made by users, such as sending funds to the wrong recipient or unintended consequences. The transaction fee budget for this type of transaction is initialized to the value specified by the budget, denominated in ether, and reverted transaction fees are refunded from this budget. If the budget is insufficient, the transaction fails and the entire budget is paid to the COINBASE specified in the block header. The remainder of the budget after all transactions are reverted is paid to the COINBASE account. This proposal is a security upgrade that enforces the immutability of deployed code. The EIP-6810 proposal is part of the Standards Track: Core and is currently in draft status.
