## Summary

ERC-4393 is a draft Ethereum Improvement Proposal that outlines a smart contract interface for tipping to non-fungible and multi tokens, allowing holders of the tokens to withdraw tips as EIP-20 rewards. The proposal defines micropayments as financial transactions involving small sums of money called "tips" that are sent to specific EIP-721 NFTs and EIP-1155 multi tokens as rewards to their holders. The proposal aims to provide a cheap way to send tips to any type of NFT or multi token by gas optimizing the tip token contract and sending tips in batches using the tipBatch function from the interface. The proposal also aims to make it easy to implement a tipping service into dapps to reward NFT and multi token holders, allowing for fairer distribution of revenue back to NFT holders from the user community.
