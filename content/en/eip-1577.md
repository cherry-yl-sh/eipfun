ERC-1577 introduces the contenthash field for ENS resolvers, which allows for a better-defined system of mapping names to network and content addresses. The contenthash field permits a wide range of protocols to be supported by ENS names, and resolvers supporting this field must return true when the supportsInterface function is called with argument 0xbc1c58d1. The fields content and multihash are deprecated. The value returned by contenthash must be represented as a machine-readable multicodec, and the encoding of the value depends on the content type specified by the protoCode. Values with protocodes of 0xe3 and 0xe4 represent IPFS and Swarm content, and these values are encoded as v1 CIDs without a base prefix. When resolving a contenthash, applications must use the protocol code to determine what type of address is encoded and resolve the address appropriately for that protocol if supported. To support contenthash, a new resolver has been developed and can be found on Mainnet and Ropsten. There are also implementations in multiple languages to encode and decode contenthash. A grace period must be implemented to offer name holders time to update their names if they have an IPFS or Swarm hash in their content field. This condition must be enforced until at least March 31st, 2019.
