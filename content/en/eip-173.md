ERC-173 is a standard for associating an ERC721-based non-fungible token (NFT) with a contract, allowing ownership of a contract to be tied to the ownership of an NFT. This approach allows the existing ERC721-based infrastructure to be used for selling, buying, and auctioning contracts. However, there are some shortcomings to this approach, such as additional complexity and infrastructure required, and the fact that the NFT would not track ownership of a contract unless it was programmed to do so. 

This standard provides a simple ownership scheme that is backwards compatible, lightweight, and easy to implement, and can be widely adopted and depended on. It does not exclude other ownership schemes from being implemented in the same contract, allowing ownership to be managed and transferred in multiple ways. 

Security considerations include ensuring that the private key of the externally owned account returned by owner() is not lost or compromised. Many existing contracts already implement this standard, and it can be extended by other standards to add additional ownership functionality. 

Overall, ERC-173 provides a standardized way to associate ownership of contracts with NFTs, allowing for more efficient and secure management of ownership.
