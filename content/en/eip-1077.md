ERC-1077 is an Ethereum Improvement Proposal that aims to make smart contracts more accessible to non-ether users by allowing contracts to accept "collect-calls", paying for incoming calls. This means that contract owners can pay for the gas to increase user acquisition or let their users pay for gas with fiat money. Alternatively, a third party may wish to subsidize the gas costs of certain contracts. The proposal allows transactions from addresses that hold no ETH. 

Gas relay for contract calls is related to ERC-1077 as it is a compliant effort to solve the problem by creating an incentive for nodes to run gas stations, where gasless transactions can be "fueled up". It abstracts the implementation details from both the dapp maintainer and the user, making it easy to convert existing dapps to accept "collect-calls". The network consists of a single public contract trusted by all participating dapp contracts, and a decentralized network of relay nodes (gas stations) incentivized to listen on non-ether interfaces such as web or whisper, pay for transactions and get compensated by that contract. The trusted contract can be verified by anyone, and the system is otherwise trustless. Gas stations cannot censor transactions as long as there's at least one honest gas station. Attempts to undermine the system can be proven on-chain and offenders can be penalized. 

In summary, ERC-1077 proposes a solution to make smart contracts more accessible to non-ether users, while gas relay for contract calls is a compliant effort to solve the problem by creating an incentive for nodes to run gas stations, where gasless transactions can be "fueled up".
