The Sealed NFT Metadata Standard (ERC-3569) is a proposed standard for Ethereum that provides a way to ensure that the metadata associated with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) remains unchanged. It allows creators to "seal" the metadata for multiple tokens at once, which is stored in a decentralized storage service like IPFS. The sealed metadata is then marked in the smart contract and cannot be changed. This provides transparency and security for potential NFT collectors, who can verify that the metadata will not be changed in the future. The standard also allows for flexibility in creating NFTs, as creators can choose to seal the metadata at a later time if they wish. The standard is backwards compatible with existing ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards and provides a cost-effective way to immortalize NFT metadata.
