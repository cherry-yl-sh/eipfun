EIP-3368 proposes to increase the block reward paid to proof-of-work (POW) miners from 2 ETH to 3 ETH and then decrease it slightly every block for approximately 2 years until it reaches 1 ETH. This change is consensus incompatible with the current public Ethereum chain and would cause a hard fork when enacted. The resulting fork would allow users to choose between two chains: one with a block reward of 1 ETH/block and another with a block reward of 3 ETH/block. This is a good choice to allow users to make. In addition, the difficulty bomb would be delayed, ensuring the network would not grind to a halt. No implementation including both block reward and difficulty adjustment is currently available.
