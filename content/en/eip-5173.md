ERC-5173 is a draft proposal for a multigenerational reward mechanism that rewards all owners of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) through a Future Rewards (FR) extension. This extension would enable owners of EIP-721 tokens (NFTs) to participate in future price increases after they sell their tokens. The proposal establishes a standard interface for a profit sharing framework in all stages of the tokenâs ownership history desired by all market participants. The proposal aims to change historical unfair trading practices and promote a new gift economic model. It is not a Ponzi scheme as it only distributes future profits when those profits are achieved rather than guaranteeing them.
