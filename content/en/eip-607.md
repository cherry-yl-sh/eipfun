EIP-607 is a hard fork of the Ethereum network named Spurious Dragon. It includes four Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) that aim to improve the network's security and efficiency. The EIPs included in Spurious Dragon are EIP-155, EIP-160, EIP-161, and EIP-170. 

EIP-155 provides protection against replay attacks, which is when a transaction is repeated on different chains, causing confusion and potential loss of funds. EIP-160 increases the cost of certain operations on the network to prevent spamming and denial-of-service attacks. EIP-161 clears the state trie, which is a data structure used to store the current state of the network, to improve efficiency and reduce storage requirements. Finally, EIP-170 limits the size of contract code to prevent excessive gas usage and improve network performance.

The Spurious Dragon hard fork was activated on the Ethereum mainnet at block 2,675,000 and on the Morden testnet at block 1,885,000. It is also known by the alias "State-clearing". 

Overall, the Spurious Dragon hard fork aimed to improve the security and efficiency of the Ethereum network by implementing several important changes.
