## Summary

The EIP-758 proposal suggests that external callers should be able to subscribe to or poll for completed transactions on the Ethereum blockchain and access the return data of functions executed when a transaction is mined. This would allow for more efficient use of the blockchain as no extra data needs to be stored and minimal extra computational load is imposed on nodes. The proposal also addresses the inconsistency between internal and external callers' access to return data.
