## Summary

The ERC-5719 proposal outlines a specification for how Sign-In with Ethereum should work. It includes requirements such as presenting a human-understandable interface, support for application servers without forcing changes in wallets, and mitigation of security attacks. The design goals are to be human-friendly, simple to implement, secure, machine-readable, and extensible. The proposal suggests using Ethereum accounts for authentication, ENS names for usernames, and data from ENS name's text records for additional profile information. The proposal also recommends using ERC-191 for signed data standard over EIP-712 for Ethereum typed structured data hashing and signing. Wallet implementers are allowed to construct a custom Sign-In with Ethereum user interface by parsing the ABNF terms into data elements for use in the interface, and translation may happen at the UX level per human language after successfully parsing the message into ABNF terms. The display rules still apply to custom interfaces.
