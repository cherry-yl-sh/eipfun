The EIP-1571 proposal contains guidelines for defining a new standard for the Stratum protocol used by Ethereum miners to communicate with mining pool servers. It addresses the lack of a well-defined standard for Stratum in Ethereum mining and aims to provide a standardized protocol for mining pools and miners to interact with each other. The proposal includes specifications for JSON-RPC-2.0 compliances and defiances, as well as details on session handling, worker authorization, mining preparation, job notification, solution submission, and hashrate reporting.
