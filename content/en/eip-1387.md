ERC-1387 proposes a method for Ethereum smart contracts to verify claims attested by a valid attester in a privacy-enabled manner. The attestation is signed and issued off the blockchain in a Merkle Tree format, with only a part of the Merkle tree revealed by the user at each use to avoid privacy issues. The proposal includes an interface and reference implementation for smart contracts that need users to provide and validate attestations. The implementation includes a struct for attestation, with fields for merklePath, valid, attester, recipient, salt, key, and val. The proposal also includes relevant implementation examples and related ERCs. The purpose of ERC-1387 is to provide a standardized method for attestation verification that is both secure and privacy-enabled.
