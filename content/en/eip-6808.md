ERC-6808 is a proposed standard interface for Fungible Key Bound Tokens (FKBTs), which are a type of digital asset that combines the fungibility of ERC-20 tokens with the security features of key-bound tokens. FKBTs allow users to add additional security to their assets on a self-custodial level, making them more resilient to attacks and thefts. The standard includes an addBindings function, which designates allowTransfer and allowApproval functions that are called by one of the ERC-20 functions. The goal of FKBTs is to provide a more intuitive and straightforward way to control digital assets in crypto, by combining the quantitative features of ERC-20 with the qualitative attributes of ERC-721. The standard is still in the process of being peer-reviewed, but it is expected to help with the adoption of digital assets by a wider demographic of users.
