EIP-2657 proposes the creation of an ephemeral testnet called Yolo for testing basic infrastructure. The testnet will be nuked after testing and is not for deploying dapps or defining what will go into mainnet. The Yolo testnet will use the YOLO-v1 ID and clients who wish to sync need to implement the specified features into their client. The proposed timeline for deployment is June 3rd, 2020. Geth has already implemented the necessary features and is ready to participate in Yolo. The syncing instructions for Geth are provided in the context. The Yolo testnet also has a support system, a genesis config json, an EF bootnode, a stats page secret, and an unauthenticated faucet.
