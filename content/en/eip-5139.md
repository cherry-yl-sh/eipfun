ERC-5139 proposes a JSON schema for describing lists of remote procedure call (RPC) providers for Ethereum-like chains, including their supported EIP-155 CHAIN_ID. The proposal aims to mitigate the risks associated with blindly adding new RPC providers using EIP-3085 without evaluating their trustworthiness. Instead, users can be provided with a comprehensive provider list built directly by their wallet, with the option of switching to whatever list they choose. The proposal specifies that list consumers (like wallets) must validate lists against the provided schema and must not connect to RPC providers present only in an invalid list. The proposal also includes a JSON-RPC specification for Ethereum nodes to implement, providing developers with a predictable Ethereum RPC interface regardless of underlying node implementation. The proposal acknowledges the paradox created by using EIP-1577 to publish the list, which requires access to ENS, and the attack vector created by whatever method the list consumer uses to fetch the list, which can track the user and lie about the contents of the list. Overall, ERC-5139 aims to provide a standardized and secure way for users to access RPC providers for Ethereum-like chains.
