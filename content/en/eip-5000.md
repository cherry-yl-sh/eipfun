## Summary

The EIP-5000 proposal introduces a new instruction, MULDIV(x, y, z), to perform ((x * y) / z) % 2**256 in 512-bit precision in Ethereum. The motivation behind this proposal is to efficiently perform fixed point multiplication and division, which are commonly used in financial applications on Ethereum. The new instruction reduces the complexity of the existing mulmod-based implementation and allows for full precision 256x256->512 multiplication in cryptographic applications. The proposal also aims to provide an instruction that can be efficiently used in both checked and unchecked arithmetic use cases. The specification of the new instruction involves popping 3 values from the stack and performing the calculation with 512-bit precision.
