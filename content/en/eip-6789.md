EIP-6789 proposes to rename the term "gas" to "mana" in Ethereum, along with renaming related opcodes and input/output parameters. The motivation behind this proposal is the shift towards Proof-of-Stake and the belief that this is the last opportunity to make such a semantic change. The specification includes using key words from RFC 2119 and RFC 8174, and the core term "gas" must be renamed to "mana". The proposal also suggests renaming GASPRICE to MANAPRICE, GASLIMIT to MANALIMIT, and GAS to MANA for related opcodes. Input parameters or outputs for CALL, CALLCODE, DELEGATECALL, and STATICCALL opcodes must also be renamed to mana. The proposal is still in draft form and has not been implemented yet.
