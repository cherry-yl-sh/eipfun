ERC-5289 proposes a standard that allows smart contracts to be legally binding by providing IPFS links to legal documents and ensuring that the users of the smart contract have privity with the relevant legal documents. The Legal Contract Library Interface defines the functions for requesting a signature and signing a document. Security considerations are taken into account, as users can claim that their private key was stolen and used to fraudulently "sign" contracts. As such, documents must only be permissive in nature, not restrictive. The EIP also includes information on backwards compatibility, a reference implementation, and copyright. The EIP is currently in the process of being peer-reviewed and interested parties can participate in the discussion.
