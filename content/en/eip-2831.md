EIP-2831 proposes an extension to the JavaScript Ethereum Provider API (EIP-1193) to create a new message type in the event a transaction replacement occurs. Currently, communication between providers and consumers of providers is fundamentally broken in the event that a transaction in the mempool has been superseded by a newer transaction. Providers currently have no way of communicating a transaction replacement, and consumers are required to poll block by block for the resulting transaction. This EIP formalizes a way for both providers and dapp developers to track transaction replacements seamlessly.
