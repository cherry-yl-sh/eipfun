## Summary

ERC-1175 is a proposal for a standard that would make it easier to use ERC20 tokens for commerce. The proposal suggests creating a mutually trusted relationship between a wallet and a shop created by an authenticated contract, which would allow for simple and efficient transactions. The proposal outlines methods and events for creating wallet and shop contracts, as well as for trading ERC20 tokens through a single call. The proposal also emphasizes backward compatibility with existing ERC20 contracts and the ability for existing contracts to adopt this standard and support additional classes without affecting their current behaviors. Overall, ERC-1175 aims to make it easier to use ERC20 tokens for commerce by creating a standardized approach for wallets and shops to interact with these tokens.
