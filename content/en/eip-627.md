The EIP-627 Whisper Specification is a standard for the format of Whisper messages within the ÐΞVp2p Wire Protocol. It aims to ensure forward compatibility of different Whisper clients by specifying the standard for Whisper messages. All Whisper messages sent as ÐΞVp2p Wire Protocol packets should be RLP-encoded arrays of data containing two objects: integer packet code followed by another object (whose type depends on the packet code). The message codes reserved for Whisper protocol are 0-127, and messages with unknown codes must be ignored for forward compatibility of future versions. The Whisper sub-protocol should support the following packet codes: Status, Messages, PoW Requirement, and Bloom Filter. The packet format and usage for Status and Messages are also specified in the EIP-627 Whisper Specification. The Status packet contains an integer message code (0x00) followed by a list of values: integer version, float PoW requirement, and bloom filter, in this order. The Messages packet contains an integer message code (0x01) followed by a list (possibly empty) of Whisper Envelopes. The EIP-627 Whisper Specification should substitute the existing specification, and more detailed documentation on Whisper can be found on the provided link.
