## Summary

The EIP-627 Whisper Specification is a standard for the format of Whisper messages within the ÃÎVp2p Wire Protocol. It aims to ensure forward compatibility of different Whisper clients by specifying the standard for Whisper messages. All Whisper messages sent as ÃÎVp2p Wire Protocol packets should be RLP-encoded arrays of data containing two objects: integer packet code followed by another object (whose type depends on the packet code). The message codes reserved for Whisper protocol are 0-127, and messages with unknown codes must be ignored for forward compatibility of future versions. The Whisper sub-protocol should support the following packet codes: Status, Messages, PoW Requirement, and Bloom Filter. The packet format and usage for Status and Messages are also specified in the EIP-627 Whisper Specification. The Status packet contains an integer message code (0x00) followed by a list of values: integer version, float PoW requirement, and bloom filter, in this order. The Messages packet contains an integer message code (0x01) followed by a list (possibly empty) of Whisper Envelopes. The EIP-627 Whisper Specification should substitute the existing specification, and more detailed documentation on Whisper can be found on the provided link.
