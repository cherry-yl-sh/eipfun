EIP-2803 proposes the addition of a new transaction type called "rich transactions" to the Ethereum network. These transactions would allow for the inclusion of arbitrary data in a transaction, which could be used for a variety of purposes such as attaching metadata to a transaction or including additional instructions for smart contracts. The proposal also includes changes to the transaction format to accommodate the new data, as well as updates to the Ethereum Virtual Machine to support the execution of rich transactions. The goal of this proposal is to increase the flexibility and functionality of transactions on the Ethereum network, while maintaining backwards compatibility with existing transactions.
