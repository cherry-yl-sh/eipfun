The ERC-5902 proposal suggests a format that allows smart contracts to respond to events emitted by other contracts in a semi-autonomous manner. It proposes the use of "hooks" that enable a smart contract function to be called automatically in response to a trigger fired by another contract, using a public relayer network as a messaging bus. The proposal relies on two interfaces, one for a publisher contract and one for a subscriber contract. The publisher contract emits events that are picked up by "relayers", who are independent entities that subscribe to "hook" events on publisher contracts, and call a function on the respective subscriber contracts whenever a hook event is fired by the publisher contracts. Whenever a relayer calls the respective subscriber's contract with the details of the hook event emitted by the publisher contract, they are paid a fee by the subscriber. Both the publisher and subscriber contracts are registered in a central registry smart contract that relayers can use to discover hooks. The proposal aims to provide a simple yet powerful primitive that can be employed by many applications in an open, permissionless, and decentralized manner.
