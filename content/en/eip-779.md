EIP-779: Hardfork Meta: DAO Fork is a document that outlines the changes made during the DAO Fork hard fork in the Ethereum blockchain. Unlike other hard forks, the DAO Fork did not change the protocol itself, but rather was an "irregular state change" that transferred ether balances from a list of accounts (known as "child DAO" contracts) into a specified account (the "WithdrawDAO" contract). This was done in response to a hack that occurred in June 2016, where a vulnerability in the DAO smart contract allowed an attacker to siphon off a large amount of ether.

The DAO Fork was activated at block 1,920,000 on the Ethereum mainnet, and involved transferring all ether throughout the accounts in the specified list to the WithdrawDAO contract. This contract was created from Solidity code and deployed on the mainnet in block 1,883,496. The deployment code and resulting runtime bytecode are also included in the EIP-779 document.

Blocks with block numbers in the range of 1,920,000 to 1,920,009 were required to have a specific hex-encoded ASCII string in the extraData field of the block to indicate that they were part of the DAO Fork.

Overall, the DAO Fork was a controversial decision that divided the Ethereum community. Some argued that it was necessary to prevent further damage from the hack, while others believed that it went against the principles of decentralization and immutability that underpin the blockchain. Regardless of one's opinion on the matter, the DAO Fork remains a significant event in the history of Ethereum and blockchain technology as a whole.
