The EIP-4520 proposal suggests reserving the bytes 0xEB and 0xEC for usage as extended opcode space in the Ethereum Virtual Machine. This would allow for the introduction of new opcodes that are likely to be infrequently used, while also being able to have greater than 256 opcodes in total. Triple byte opcodes may be doubly-prefixed by 0xEB EB, 0xEC EC, 0xEB EC and 0xEC EB. The proposal also mentions that previous usage of 0xEB and 0xEC may result in unexpected behavior and broken code. There are no known security considerations.
