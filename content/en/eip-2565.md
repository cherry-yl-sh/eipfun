The EIP-2565 proposal aims to accurately reflect the real-world operational cost of the ModExp precompile by specifying an algorithm for calculating the gas cost. This will reduce the cost of cryptographic functions that rely on modular exponentiation, making them more practical and enabling improved security, stronger randomness, and more. The gas cost of calling the precompile at address 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000005 will be calculated based on the new algorithm. The biggest security consideration for this EIP is creating a potential DoS vector by making ModExp operations too inexpensive relative to their computation time.
