The ERC-5375 proposal standardizes a JSON format for storing off-chain information about NFT authors. It adds a new field which provides a list of author names, addresses, and proofs of authorship consent: proofs that the authors have agreed to be named as authors. The motivation behind this proposal is that there is currently no standard to identify authors of an NFT, and existing techniques have issues. The proposal defines a protocol to verify that a certain address provided consent, but it does not guarantee that the address corresponds to the expected creator. Proving a link between an address and the entity behind it is beyond the scope of this document. The proposal also includes security considerations, such as the potential for creators to unintentionally sign creator attribution consent messages. The proposal is an extension of EIP-721 for NFT authorship and author consent. It is recommended that smart contract developers do not add support for unverifiable information to the JSON document to prevent author spoofing. The proposal does not require additional replay attack countermeasures, as the chain id, contract address, and token id uniquely identify an NFT. The proposal is available for citation and copyright and related rights are waived via CC0.
