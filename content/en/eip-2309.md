ERC-2309 is an extension to the ERC-721 standard for non-fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides a standardized event that can be emitted during the creation or transfer of one or many non-fungible tokens with consecutive token identifiers. This extension assumes that token identifiers are in consecutive order. The motivation behind this extension is to provide even more scalability to the ERC-721 specification. While it is possible to create, transfer, and burn 2^256 non-fungible tokens in one transaction, it is not possible to emit that many Transfer events in one transaction. The original Transfer event can only be emitted for one token at a time, which gives us O(n) time complexity. This extension solves that problem by providing a standard mechanism for emitting Transfer events for many tokens at once. Many decentralized marketplaces and block explorers utilize the Transfer event as a way to determine which NFTs an address owns. The Consecutive Transfer Extension provides a standard mechanism for these platforms to use to determine ownership of many tokens.
