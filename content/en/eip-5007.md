The ERC-5007 standard is an extension of ERC-721 that proposes an additional role called "user" which can be granted to addresses for a limited time. This user role represents permission to "use" the NFT, but not the ability to transfer it or set users. This is useful for NFTs that have certain utilities, such as virtual land or game assets, where the owner may rent it out to a user. The actions that a user can take with the NFT would be different from the owner, so separate roles are needed to manage permissions accordingly. This standard provides a unified way for applications to collaborate and manage these roles.
