EIP-3026 proposes the addition of seven separate precompiles to perform operations on the BW6-761 curve, which is necessary for efficiently performing verification of one-layer composed zkSNARKs proofs. These precompiles include point addition and multiplication on a curve defined over a prime field, multiexponentiation on a curve defined over a prime field, point addition and multiplication on a curve twist defined over a prime field, multiexponentiation on a curve twist defined over a prime field, and pairing operations between a set of pairs of (G1, G2) points. The multiexponentiation operations are a generalization of point multiplication, but separate precompiles are proposed because running a single multiplication through multiexponentiation seems to be 20% more expensive. The implementation includes a Golang implementation with Intel assembly and precompiles for OpenEthereum (EY/Parity), as well as SageMath and Magma scripts. The document emphasizes the importance of a "constant time" property for performed operations, but explicitly states that this precompile is not required to perform all operations using constant time algorithms. The document also notes that strictly following the spec will eliminate security implications or consensus implications in contrast to the previous BN254 precompile.
