The EIP-2584 proposal suggests a method to convert the state trie format in Ethereum from hexary to binary by storing new values in a binary trie overlaid on the hexary trie. The conversion process is done in four phases, with new state writes made to an overlay binary trie in the first phase while the hexary trie is being converted to binary. The overlay tree is then merged back into the newly converted binary base trie in the second phase, and the field holding its root is removed from the block header in the third and final phase.
