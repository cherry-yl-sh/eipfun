EIP-5806 is a proposal to expand the ability of externally owned accounts (EOAs) to interact with smart contracts by using a pre-existing and well-understood delegation mechanism introduced in EIP-7, without adding new complexity to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The proposal suggests using a transaction envelope (EIP-2718) to ensure backward compatibility and prevent replay attacks through the nonce mechanism. Contracts being called through this mechanism can execute any operation on behalf of the signer, so signers should be extremely careful when signing this transaction.
