The ERC-777 Token Standard is a proposal for a new token standard on the Ethereum blockchain. It aims to improve upon the existing ERC-20 standard by providing additional functionality and flexibility for token transfers. Some of the key features of ERC-777 include the ability to send tokens to contracts, the ability to reject incoming token transfers, and the ability to customize token behavior based on the recipient's address. The proposal was authored by Jacques Dafflon, Jordi Baylina, and Thomas Shababi and was published in November 2017 as part of the Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP) series.
