## Summary

ERC-1753 proposes an Ethereum standard for the issuance of licenses, permits, and grants. A license is a limited and temporary authority granted to a natural or legal person to do something that would otherwise be unlawful pursuant to a legal framework. The proposed standard allows issuing authorities or regulators to amend, revoke, or deny licenses from time to time, with the result of their determinations reflected in the license token in near real-time. License holders will therefore be notified almost instantly of any amendments, revocations, or issues involving their license. Smart contracts can be used to embed regulatory requirements with respect to the relevant license in the blockchain. The license would be available electronically in the form of a token, stored in a digital wallet, typically an application on a smartphone or tablet computer. The proposed interface includes functions for granting and revoking authority, issuing and revoking licenses, and checking if a license is valid. A Solidity example is provided in the document.
