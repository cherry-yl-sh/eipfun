EIP-5757 is a proposal that outlines the requirements and process for approving external resources that may be linked to Ethereum improvement proposals (EIPs). The proposal states that permissible origins must provide a method of uniquely identifying a particular revision of a resource, have a proven history of availability for at least ten years, and not charge a fee for accessing resources. If an approved origin ceases to satisfy these requirements, it must be removed from EIP-1. The proposal also emphasizes the importance of free access and openness in the Ethereum ecosystem. The editors of EIP-1 will determine if an origin meets the requirements and update the document to include the name of the allowed origin, permitted markup and formatting required when referring to resources from the origin, and a fully rendered example of what a link should look like. The proposal aims to ensure immutability, availability, and free access to external resources linked to EIPs.
