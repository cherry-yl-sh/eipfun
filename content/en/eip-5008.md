## Summary

The ERC-5008 proposal suggests adding a nonce function to ERC-721 tokens to prevent attacks on NFT marketplaces. When users transfer an NFT to another wallet and then back to the original wallet, it can reactivate an order and list the token at a much lower price than intended. The addition of a nonce property to ERC-721 tokens would change the nonce when a token is transferred, allowing orders to be checked to avoid attacks. The proposal also suggests creating a standard for art NFTs, allowing artists to maintain a connection with the Ethereum blockchain and their fans who purchase their tokens. This would involve designating an original NFT and printed editions with signatures in a trustless manner, providing a standard method for designating the original and limited-edition prints with signatures from the artist. ERC-721 compliant contracts may implement this ERC for editions.
