EIP-6466 proposes a migration process of existing Merkle-Patricia Trie (MPT) commitments for receipts to Simple Serialize (SSZ) in Ethereum. This aligns the encoding of the receipts_root, taking advantage of the more modern SSZ format, which brings several benefits such as better support for light clients and smart contracts, and reducing complexity. ReceiptLog data is formatted according to the Ethereum contract ABI, and log data is provided as a ByteVector for now, with the option for a future EIP to extend it. The proposal includes information on backwards compatibility, test cases, and a reference implementation.
