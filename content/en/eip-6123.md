The ERC-6123 proposal is for a Smart Derivative Contract, which is a deterministic protocol for trading and processing financial derivative contracts in a completely automated way, removing counterparty credit risk and known operational risks and complexities in post-trade processing. The proposal aims to detach bilateral financial transactions from counterparty credit risk and remove complexities in bilateral post-trade processing by a complete redesign. The contract is designed to be frictionless and scalable, with all process states fully specified and known to the counterparties. The proposal includes a specification for trade events and process events, as well as a state diagram of trade and process states and a sequence diagram of trade initiation and settlement lifecycle. The proposal also includes test cases, a reference implementation, and a suggestion for a trade data specification. The proposal is still in draft form as of December 2022.
