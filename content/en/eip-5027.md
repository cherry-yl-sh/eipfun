## Summary

The purpose of EIP-5027 is to remove the limit on contract code size in Ethereum and only limit it by block gas limit, with minimal changes to existing code and proper gas metering adjustment to avoid possible attacks. It aims to address the issues with the current limit on contract code size by allowing users to deploy larger contracts without having to split them into several sub-contracts, which can increase the burden of developing, deploying, and maintaining smart contracts.
