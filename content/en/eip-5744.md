The ERC-5744 proposal is an extension of the EIP-20 standard that allows tokens to become fungible after a non-fungible period. Once minted, tokens are non-fungible until they reach maturity, at which point they become fungible and can be transferred, traded, and used in any way that a standard EIP-20 token can be used. The proposal includes the addition of a new method called balanceOfMatured to the ABI, which returns the balance of matured tokens for a given address, and an additional method called getMints, which returns an array of all mint metadata for a given address. The proposal is fully backward compatible with the EIP-20 standard and has no known compatibility issues with other standards. The security considerations note that iterating over large arrays of mints is not recommended, as this can be very expensive and may cause the protocol or user interactions with it to be stuck if it exceeds the block gas limit and reverts.
