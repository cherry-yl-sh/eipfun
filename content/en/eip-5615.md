ERC-5615 is an Ethereum Improvement Proposal that extends the ERC-1155 token standard by adding a totalSupply function and an exists function. These functions were modeled after the ERC-721 and ERC-20 standards. The totalSupply function returns the total number of tokens that have been minted for a given token ID, while the exists function checks if a token with a given ID exists. The exists function is included to differentiate between the two ways that totalSupply could equal zero. 

The proposal is designed to be backward compatible with the OpenZeppelin ERC1155Supply. There are no security considerations for this proposal, and copyright and related rights have been waived via CC0. 

Overall, ERC-5615 aims to make it easier for developers to track the total supply of tokens and check if a token with a given ID exists. This can be useful for various use cases, such as managing inventory or tracking ownership of unique assets.
