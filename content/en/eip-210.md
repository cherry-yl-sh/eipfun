EIP-210, titled "Blockhash Refactoring," proposes storing block hashes in the state, reducing the protocol complexity and the need for client implementation complexity to process the BLOCKHASH opcode. It also extends the range of how far back blockhash checking can go, creating direct links between blocks with very distant block numbers, which facilitates much more efficient initial light client syncing.

The EIP introduces a new contract, the BLOCKHASH_CONTRACT, with its address and code specified. When the block number equals the CONSTANTINOPLE_FORK_BLKNUM, the code of the BLOCKHASH_CONTRACT_ADDR is set to BLOCKHASH_CONTRACT_CODE. When the block number is greater than or equal to the CONSTANTINOPLE_FORK_BLKNUM, a call is executed before processing any transactions, with the parameters: SENDER: SUPER_USER, GAS: 1000000, TO: BLOCKHASH_CONTRACT_ADDR, VALUE: 0, DATA: <32 bytes corresponding to the blockâs prevhash>.

The EIP also provides the Serpent source code and the EVM init code for the BLOCKHASH_CONTRACT_CODE. The rationale behind this EIP is to remove the need for implementations to have an explicit way to look into historical block hashes, simplifying the protocol definition and removing a large component of the "implied state."
