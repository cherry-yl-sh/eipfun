EIP-665 proposes adding a precompiled contract for Ed25519 signature verification to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Ed25519 is a cryptographic signature algorithm that is designed to be fast, secure, and resistant to side-channel attacks. However, implementing Ed25519 verification in EVM bytecode is computationally expensive and results in high gas costs. The proposed precompiled contract would provide a native compiled function for Ed25519 signature verification, solving both cost and performance issues. The addition of this precompiled contract would enable performant and cheap verification of Ed25519 cryptographic signatures in smart contracts on the Ethereum network.
