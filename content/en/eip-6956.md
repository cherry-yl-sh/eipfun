ERC-6956 proposes a standard for asset-bound non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that are anchored to physical or digital assets without signing capabilities. An asset is marked with a uniquely identifiable anchor, which is bound in a secure and inseparable manner to an NFT on-chain over the complete life cycle of the asset. An oracle attests that a particular asset associated with an anchor has been controlled when defining the to-address for certain operations such as mint, transfer, burn, and approve. The oracle signs the attestation off-chain, and the operations are authorized through verifying on-chain that the attestation has been signed by a trusted oracle. Authorization is solely provided through the attestation, or in other words, through proof-of-control over the asset. The controller of the asset is guaranteed to be the controller of the asset-bound NFT. The standard extends ERC-721 and allows integrating physical and digital assets into dApps/web3. The standard also defines several interfaces, including the base interface, oracle, attestation-limited interface, floatable interface, and valid-anchors interface. The standard provides example use cases and recommended combinations of interfaces, as well as security considerations for physical and digital assets.
