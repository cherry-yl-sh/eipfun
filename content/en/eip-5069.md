## Summary

EIP-5069 is a proposal that outlines the recommended process for becoming an EIP editor. An EIP editor is responsible for reviewing and merging Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), which are design documents that provide information to the Ethereum community or describe new features for Ethereum or its processes or environment. The proposal states that anyone with a good understanding of the EIP standardization and network upgrade process, intermediate level experience on the core and/or application side of the Ethereum blockchain, and willingness to contribute to the process management may apply to become an EIP editor. The potential EIP editor should have good communication skills, the ability to handle contentious discourse, and 1-5 spare hours per week. The proposal recommends that anyone desirous of becoming an EIP editor should understand EIP-1, which is the Ethereum Improvement Proposal standardization process, and participate in the EIP process by commenting on and suggesting improvements to PRs and issues. The contributions of newer editors should be monitored by other EIP editors. Anyone meeting the above requirements may make a pull request adding themselves as an EIP editor and adding themselves to the editor list at config/eip-editors.yml and in EIP-1. If every existing EIP editor approves, the author becomes a full EIP editor. The proposal also provides guidelines for EIP titles, descriptions, and numbers, and recommends following RFC 2119 and RFC 8174 for terminology. The EIP Editor Handbook is a handy reference for EIP editors and those who want to become one.
