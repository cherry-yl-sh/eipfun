EIP-689 proposes to make contract creation fail on an account with nonempty code or non-zero nonce in case of address collisions, which would cause failures of contract creation.

This EIP is backwards compatible on the main network and has no effects after the Constantinople fork because EIP-86 contains the changes proposed in this EIP.
