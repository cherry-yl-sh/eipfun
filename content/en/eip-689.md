EIP-689 proposes to make contract creation fail on an account with nonempty code or non-zero nonce in case of address collisions, which would cause failures of contract creation. The motivation behind this proposal is to simplify testing and reasoning, and it has no practical relevance to the main net history. This EIP is backwards compatible on the main network and has no effects after the Constantinople fork because EIP-86 contains the changes proposed in this EIP.
