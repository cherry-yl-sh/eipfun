## Summary

ERC-2157 is proposing an optional storage extension for dType, a decentralized type system, that standardizes the ABI of the dType storage contracts, enabling easy navigation and retrieval of type data that is intended to be of public use. This enables a more effective on-chain and off-chain use of data and opens up possibilities for decentralized applications, enabling developers to build on top of public global data.
