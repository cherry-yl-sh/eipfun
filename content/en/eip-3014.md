The EIP-3014 proposal suggests adding a new JSON-RPC method called eth_symbol to the Ethereum protocol. This method would allow clients to retrieve the symbol associated with a given token address on the Ethereum network. The proposal notes that while this may not be the best mechanism for communication between applications and the blockchain, it aligns with established practices within the community and would enable quick integration with existing systems. The security considerations section notes that the relationship between the Ethereum Provider and client is trusted, and assumes that the user trusts the Ethereum Provider. The proposal includes the necessary parts for a successful EIP, including a preamble, abstract, and optional motivation section.
