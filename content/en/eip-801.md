The ERC-801: Canary Standard is a proposed standard interface for canary contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. A canary contract is a type of smart contract that is designed to provide a warning if certain conditions are met, such as if a government agency issues a warrant or subpoena for user data. The canary contract is fed regularly with a specific message or transaction, and if the message or transaction stops being received, it is assumed that the conditions have been met and the canary is considered "dead". 

The ERC-801 standard provides a basic set of functions for implementing canary contracts, including the ability to check if the canary is alive, keep the canary alive, and manage feeders. The standard also includes a set of events, such as the "RIP" event that triggers when the contract is called for the first time after the canary has died. 

The motivation behind the ERC-801 standard is to provide a standardized interface for canary contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, making it easier for other applications to interface with canaries, such as for visualizing the state, automated alarms, or contracts that use the state. The standard also allows for different types of canaries to be implemented, such as those with single or multiple feeders, or those designed for IoT applications. 

While the ERC-801 standard is still in draft form and has not yet been implemented, it represents an important step towards standardizing the use of canary contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. By providing a common interface for canaries, the standard could help to increase the adoption of this important tool for protecting user privacy and security.
