The ERC-1923 zk-SNARK Verifier Registry Standard is a proposed standard interface for a contract API that allows for the registration of zk-SNARKs, which are zero-knowledge proofs used for private transactions, computations, and scaling solutions on the Ethereum blockchain. The standard aims to make it easier for applications to implement private transactions and contracts, as well as scaling solutions, by providing a standardized way to register all zk-SNARKs. The standard also allows for the extraction and interpretation of limited information emitted during zk-SNARK verifications. The motivation for standardizing a registry is to provide a more efficient and secure way for consumers of information to interface with the standard verifier registry. The standard references other Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) such as EIP-165, EIP-196, and EIP-197, as well as educational material on zk-SNARKs. However, the referenced verifier registry implementations are not yet ready for deployment, and the standard needs to be updated to provide references to deployed versions of these implementations. Overall, the ERC-1923 zk-SNARK Verifier Registry Standard is a proposed standard interface that aims to make it easier for applications to implement private transactions and contracts, as well as scaling solutions, by providing a standardized way to register all zk-SNARKs.
