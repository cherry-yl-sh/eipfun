The proposal outlined in EIP-3143 is to increase the block rewards paid to proof-of-work (POW) miners to 5 ETH. This will be done by adjusting the block, uncle, and nephew rewards starting with FORK_BLKNUM block. The motivation behind this proposal is to reduce the volatility in terms of the percentage of transaction fees that make up the mining rewards per block while increasing the total rewards per block, making it more financially attractive to POW miners to mine ETH. This will also allow smaller POW miners ample opportunity to build up their stores of ETH so that when the time comes to fully transition to ETH 2.0, they may be more willing to become validators as they already have earned the required amount of ETH needed to do so.
