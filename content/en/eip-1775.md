ERC-1775 proposes a new type of wallet account called "app keys" that are derived specifically for each given application. These accounts allow for isolation of accounts used for each application, potentially increasing privacy and giving more control to application developers over account management and signing delegation. Wallets can have a more permissive level of security for app keys while keeping main accounts secure. This new account type can significantly improve user experience and permit new designs for applications of the crypto permissioned web. The proposal also includes a private app key generation algorithm, rationale for sharing application keys across domains, and example use cases. The document includes references to related proposals and discussions, as well as acknowledgements to contributors.
