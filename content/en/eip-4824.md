## Summary

ERC-4824 is a proposal for a standard API for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) in Ethereum. It aims to provide common interfaces for relating on-chain and off-chain representations of membership and proposals, and to enhance DAO discoverability, legibility, proposal simulation, and interoperability between tools. The proposal includes specifications for indexing, members, proposals, activity log, contracts, and governance, and uses JSON-LD to support use-cases where a DAO wants to include members using some other form of identification than their Ethereum address and to be compatible with future multi-chain standards. The proposal was developed with input from representatives from major EVM-based DAO frameworks, DAO tooling developers, and major DAOs, and is designed to be backwards compatible and to consider security considerations related to data preparation and governance.
