EIP-3337 proposes the introduction of four new opcodes for more efficient memory access offset by a user-controlled quantity called the "frame pointer". This allows compilers to offload ephemeral data such as local variables to memory instead of the EVM's evaluation stack, which has several benefits, including the effective elimination of restrictions on the number of local variables in a function. The current EVM model requires a compiler to store the frame pointer in memory and load it each time they wish to reference it, which consumes a total of 15 gas and takes up at least 7 bytes of bytecode each time it is referenced. After this EIP, the equivalent sequence of operations consumes only 6 gas and takes at least 3 bytes of bytecode. The effort required from the EVM implementation is equivalent, costing only one extra addition operation over a regular MLOAD. The alternative of storing values on the stack, which requires 3 gas and 1 byte of bytecode for a DUPn operation, is now at most twice as efficient rather than 5 times as efficient, making storing values in memory a viable alternative. This proposal does not impose undue burden on EVM implementers or on runtime efficiency.
