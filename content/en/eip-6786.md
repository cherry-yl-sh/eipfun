ERC-6786 proposes a standard for a registry that allows anyone to pay royalties for a certain NFT and keep track of the royalties amount paid. The payment can be made in native coins, and the information about the paid royalties is public, which helps to prevent under the table trading or marketplaces that don't support royalties. The function used for payment can be called by anyone, not only the NFT owner, to support the creator at any time. The standard uses ERC-2981 for fetching creator on-chain data, but any other on-chain method of getting the creator address is accepted. The standard is backward compatible and includes test cases in ERC6786.test.js. There are no security considerations related directly to the implementation of this standard. The standard aims to provide a way of knowing if there are any royalties left unpaid for the NFT trades that took place in a marketplace that does not support them and, in that case, expose a way of paying them. Overall, the standard provides a way for anyone to pay royalties to NFT creators, not just the owner, and helps to incentivize creators to keep contributing to the NFT ecosystem.
