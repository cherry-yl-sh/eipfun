## Summary

The ERC-5553 proposal introduces a way to represent intellectual property (IP) and its royalty structure on the Ethereum blockchain. This standard is not specific to any type of IP and can represent various types of IP, such as music, videos, books, and images. The proposal allows market participants to observe the on-chain representation of IP, discover its attached metadata, and understand its related royalty structure. This will enable building registration, licensing, and payout mechanisms for IP assets in the future. The proposal suggests separating the IP contract from the collectible and licensing NFTs to enable scaling licensing types. It also introduces a royaltyPortionTokens() function to present a more robust royalty portions structure. The proposal recommends that registry contracts own the IP registration, which will be non-transferrable and account-bound to the registry that created it to address potential security challenges. The proposal is in the process of being peer-reviewed, and the copyright and related rights are waived via CC0.
