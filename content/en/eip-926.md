ERC-926 is a proposed standard for a registry of address metadata on the Ethereum blockchain. This registry would allow both contracts and external accounts to provide metadata about themselves to onchain and offchain callers. The purpose of this registry is to prevent a proliferation of specialized registry contracts for different use cases, and instead provide a single standardized registry that can be extended to accommodate future metadata standards.

The metadata registry has two functions: setProvider and provider. setProvider specifies the metadata registry to be associated with the caller's address, while provider returns the address of the metadata registry for the supplied address. Providers may implement any subset of the metadata record types specified in the standard, and must throw if called with an unsupported function ID. Providers also have a mandatory function, supportsInterface, which returns whether or not the provider supports a given interface ID.

The ERC-926 standard is designed to be fully decentralized and provide a unique address for all chains, solving the problem of resolving the correct registry address for different chains. The standard also includes an exact copy of the code for the ERC820 registry smart contract, which governs the allocation of names in the Ethereum Name Service (ENS).

Overall, the ERC-926 standard aims to provide a simple and extendable solution for storing metadata associated with Ethereum addresses, allowing for a wide range of use cases such as generalised authorizations, token acceptance settings, and claims registries.
