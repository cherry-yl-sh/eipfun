The EIP-170 proposal is an Ethereum Improvement Proposal that suggests a limit on the size of contract code. The purpose of this proposal is to prevent the creation of excessively large contracts that could potentially cause issues with network performance and scalability. The proposal suggests a limit of 24,576 bytes for contract code, which is roughly equivalent to 24 kilobytes. This limit would apply to all new contracts created on the Ethereum network. The proposal also suggests that existing contracts that exceed this limit should be grandfathered in and allowed to continue operating as they currently do. The rationale behind this proposal is to ensure that the Ethereum network remains efficient and scalable as it continues to grow and evolve. In summary, the EIP-170 proposal aims to limit the size of contract code on the Ethereum network to improve network performance and scalability. (Word count: 120)
