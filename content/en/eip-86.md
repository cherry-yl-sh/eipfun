The EIP-86 proposal suggests abstracting the transaction origin and signature in Ethereum to enable smart contract systems to access the original transaction data at any given step in the call chain execution. This could result in cross-contract calls consuming less gas if the data passed between them is reduced. However, this gas reduction would only be applicable for rudimentary memory arguments and not storage-based data, which is commonly utilized in these types of calls. Therefore, the overall gas reduction observed by this change would be negligible for most implementations.
