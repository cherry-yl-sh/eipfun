## Summary

The ERC-5521 proposal suggests creating a standard for NFTs specifically designed for digital art and music. It aims to provide a more tangible link between the NFT, the artist, and the owner by allowing artists to sign their work and designate limited-edition prints with immutable signatures. This creates a trustlessly enforced link between the artist and the NFT. The proposal also provides a standard method for designating the original and limited-edition prints with signatures from the artist. The goal is to make it easier for artists to maintain a connection with the Ethereum blockchain and their fans who purchase their tokens. The proposal acknowledges that the use cases for NFTs have evolved into works of digital art, and there is a need to designate an original NFT and printed editions with signatures in a trustless manner. Overall, the proposal aims to remove the distance between the artist and the NFT and provide readily available functionality for artists to sign their work and for third-party applications to display the uniqueness of a NFT.
