EIP-4938 proposes to remove the GetNodeData and NodeData messages from the Ethereum Wire Protocol. These messages were introduced in protocol version eth/63 to support a sync mode called "fast sync", which downloads the Ethereum state without executing all blocks. However, serving GetNodeData requests requires clients to store state as a mapping of hashes to trie nodes, which is not compatible with some client implementations. Therefore, removing these messages from the protocol would accurately reflect the capabilities of clients and avoid the need to store such a mapping in the database. 

The EIP specifies that the eth protocol should remove the following message types: GetNodeData (0x0d) and NodeData (0x0e). A replacement for GetNodeData is available in the snap protocol, where clients can use the GetByteCodes and GetTrieNodes messages instead. The snap protocol can be used to implement the "fast sync" algorithm, but it is recommended to use it for "snap sync". 

The EIP does not change the consensus rules of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and does not require a hard fork. It only changes the eth protocol and requires rolling out a new version, eth/67. Supporting multiple versions of a wire protocol is possible, and rolling out a new version does not break older clients immediately, since they can keep using protocol version eth/66. 

In summary, EIP-4938 proposes to remove the GetNodeData and NodeData messages from the Ethereum Wire Protocol to accurately reflect the capabilities of clients and avoid the need to store a mapping of hashes to trie nodes. A replacement for GetNodeData is available in the snap protocol, and rolling out a new version of the eth protocol does not require a hard fork and does not change the consensus rules of the EVM.
