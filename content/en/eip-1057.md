EIP-1057 proposes a new Proof-of-Work algorithm called ProgPoW to replace Ethash, which is currently used in Ethereum mining. ProgPoW is designed to be "ASIC-resistant" by utilizing almost all parts of commodity hardware (GPUs) and closing the efficiency gap available to specialized ASICs. The goal of ASIC-resistance is to resist the centralization of PoW mining power, making it more difficult for a few players to manipulate the system. ProgPoW comes pre-tuned for the most common hardware utilized in the Ethereum network and is intended to incentivize a geographically-distributed community of miners with a low barrier to entry on commodity hardware. The document presents an overview of the algorithm, examines what it means to be ASIC-resistant, compares existing PoW designs, and presents the detailed implementation by walking through the code. The reference ProgPoW mining implementation is located at the @ifdefelse ProgPOW repository. EIP-1588 is a meta-EIP that specifies the changes included in the alternative Ethereum hardfork named Ethereum ProgPoW, which includes EIP-1057. The activation block for Ethereum ProgPoW is set to be block >= 7280000 on the Ethereum mainnet.
