ERC-5143 is a proposed standard that extends the EIP-4626 Tokenized Vault standard with functions dedicated to safe interaction between EOAs and the vault when the price is subject to slippage. It proposes an overloaded version of ERC-4626's deposit function that mints shares of the vault to the receiver by depositing exactly the assets of underlying tokens. The proposal aims to standardize the function signatures and behaviors for improved interoperability and better support by wallets.
