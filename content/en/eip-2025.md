EIP-2025 proposes adding 0.0055 ETH per block for 18 months as a developer block reward reserved for funding specific Ethereum1.X working groups. The working groups are State rent, Better sync, Finality gadget, Fee market, and Testing infrastructure. The funds will be governed through a multisig of trusted individuals from the ecosystem including client teams, the foundation, and the community. The motivation for this proposal is to provide funding for Eth1.X development, which is currently hindered by a lack of funding. The proposal also includes a plan for loan repayment and accountability. The total amount raised is estimated to be around USD $2,325,000.00 over the next 18 months.
