EIP-5793 proposes adding a new version of the Ethereum wire protocol, eth/68, that includes a new field for transaction type in the transaction announcement message. This change will make the protocol future-proof for new transaction types and give receiving nodes better control over the data they fetch from peers. The change does not require a hard fork and is backwards compatible with older clients that can continue using protocol version eth/67. There are no security considerations associated with this proposal.
