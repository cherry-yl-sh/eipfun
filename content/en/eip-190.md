The ERC-190 proposal is a specification for Ethereum smart contract packages, which was collaboratively developed by several Ethereum development framework maintainers. The purpose of this proposal is to introduce packaging as a core piece of modern software development in the Ethereum ecosystem, which is currently missing. The lack of packaging limits the ability for developers to reuse code, negatively affecting productivity and security. The proposal aims to increase productivity and security by allowing developers to reuse existing code and well-audited implementations of common patterns, such as ERC20 and crowdfunding. Additionally, smart contract packaging should have a direct positive effect on end-users, as wallet software will be able to consume a released package and generate an interface for interacting with any deployed contracts included within that package.
