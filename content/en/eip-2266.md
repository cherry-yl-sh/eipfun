The ERC-2266 standard is a proposal for a common way of implementing Atomic Swap-based American Call Option payment functionality in token contracts. Atomic Swap allows for the exchange of tokens without the need for a trusted third party, and the Hashed Time-Locked Contract (HTLC) protocol is commonly used for its implementation. However, the HTLC-based Atomic Swap has optionality, which can be utilized to construct American Call Options without a trusted third party. This standard defines the technical terms, interfaces, and reference implementations of this protocol. The initiator is the party who publishes the advertisement of the swap. The standard aims to provide a secure Atomic-Swap-based American Call Option protocol on smart contracts that eliminates arbitrage opportunities and prevents any party from locking the other party's money maliciously. The syntax and semantics of Ethereum smart contracts should be followed in the implementation of this standard. The proposal is currently in the process of being peer-reviewed, and interested parties are encouraged to participate in the discussion.
