EIP-684 is an Ethereum Improvement Proposal that aims to enforce the immutability of deployed code by reverting creation in case of collision. This is a security upgrade that addresses the risks associated with gas cost increases on storage-accessing opcodes. The proposal includes the use of an accessed_addresses and accessed_storage_keys map to make some cases recoverable, reducing risks significantly. Additionally, the proposal suggests the addition of a POKE precompile and EIP-2930 to expand the usability of this pattern and mitigate contract breakage. Overall, EIP-684 is a measure to ensure the security and stability of the Ethereum network by enforcing the immutability of deployed code.
