The ERC-5187 proposal suggests extending the EIP-1155 standard by introducing separable, rentable, and transferable usage rights in the form of NFT-IDs. This would allow the property owner to rent out the NFT to multiple users for different terms and withdraw it upon expiration through smart contract. The property owner would always retain ownership and be able to transfer the NFT to others during the lease. The proposal also supports subleasing and renewal of the rental, as well as early return of NFTs by subletting the usage rights back to the property owners. The motivation behind this proposal is to create a new leasing model that is decentralized, collateral-free, and operated purely "on-chain," which could disrupt the way people trade and use NFTs. The proposal is fully backward compatible with EIP-1155.
