## Summary

ERC-5725 proposes a standard for transferable vesting NFTs, which allow for the vesting of ERC-20 tokens over a release curve. This standard provides a unified interface for vesting contracts, enabling the creation of an ecosystem of on- and off-chain tooling around these contracts. It also allows for liquid vesting in the form of non-fungible assets, which can be transferred and have metadata attached to them. The standard supports a variety of different vesting curves, including linear and cliff vesting. The proposal includes specifications for vesting functions, timestamps, and limitations of scope, as well as extension possibilities. The standard is fully backwards compatible with any current ERC-721 integrations and marketplaces, and includes test cases and a reference implementation. Security considerations include the need to keep track of claimed tokens and to prevent giving out more tokens than allotted for a specific vesting NFT. The proposal is currently in the process of being peer-reviewed.
