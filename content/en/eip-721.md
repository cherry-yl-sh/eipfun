The ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token Standard is a set of rules and guidelines for creating and managing unique digital assets on the Ethereum blockchain. These assets, known as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), are distinct and cannot be exchanged for one another like traditional cryptocurrencies. The standard provides a basic API for tracking and transferring ownership of NFTs within smart contracts. nnThe motivation behind creating this standard was to allow for interoperability between different NFT applications and platforms. By providing a common interface, developers can create wallets, brokers, and auction applications that work with any ERC-721 compliant NFT. nnThe standard was inspired by the ERC-20 token standard, which is used for creating fungible tokens on Ethereum. However, ERC-20 is not suitable for tracking NFTs because each asset is unique and cannot be exchanged for another. nnThe ERC-721 standard allows for a diverse range of assets to be represented as NFTs, including physical property, virtual collectibles, and even negative value assets like loans and responsibilities. Each NFT is distinguishable and must be tracked separately. nnOverall, the ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token Standard provides a simple and widely adopted way to create and manage unique digital assets on the Ethereum blockchain.
