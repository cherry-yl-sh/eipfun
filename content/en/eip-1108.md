EIP-1108 is a proposal to reduce the gas costs for the alt_bn128 precompile in Ethereum, which is used for elliptic curve cryptography. This reduction in gas costs would make it more practical to use cryptographic protocols such as zk-SNARKs and confidential transactions on the Ethereum network. The proposal does not require Parity or Geth to deploy new cryptographic libraries, as fast bn128 algorithms have already been integrated into these clients. The goal is to supplement EIP-1829 (arithmetic over generic elliptic curves) and provide an immediate solution to the problem of expensive cryptography, while more advanced solutions are developed, defined and deployed.
