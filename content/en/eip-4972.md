The ERC-4972 proposal suggests expanding the capabilities of the name service, such as ENS, by enabling each human-readable identity to be linked to a single smart contract account that can be controlled by the owner of the name identity. This smart contract account is called a Name-Owned Account (NOA) and has a human-readable name defined by ERC-137, an owned account whose address is derived from the name, and owner(s) of the name that can deploy and manipulate the owned account. The NOA allows for holding assets and information for its name node, opening up new use cases such as name node transfers, which involve transferring ownership of the name node as well as the NOA, including any assets and information it holds. The proposal also includes an interface for wallet implementers to construct a custom Sign-In With Ethereum user interface and supporting internationalization. The rationale behind the proposal is to give name rich context by offering each name owner an extra ready-to-use smart contract account, which may help the general smart contract account adoption. The design goals of the proposal are human-friendly, simple to implement, secure, machine-readable, and extensible. The technical decisions include using ERC-191 (Signed Data Standard) over EIP-712 (Ethereum typed structured data hashing and signing).
