## Summary

EIP-3779 proposes a set of validity rules to ensure that EVM contracts cannot encounter an exceptional halting state, which would make them unsafe. The rules restrict the use of existing and proposed control-flow instructions, but do not introduce any new opcodes. The restrictions must be validated at contract initialization time, not at runtime, by an algorithm that takes time and space near-linear in the size of the contract to avoid being a denial of service vulnerability. The specification is entirely semantic and imposes no further syntax on bytecode. The motivation for this proposal is to improve safety and security by preventing unsafe contracts from being placed on the blockchain. The proposal also aims to enable static analysis and formal verification of contracts, which is currently inhibited by the lack of support for static jumps and subroutines in the EVM. By introducing these features and restricting dynamic jumps, the EVM can be a better target for code generation from other languages, and validations and optimizations can be done at deployment time with near-linear time complexity. The proposal depends on EIP-1702 for a versioning scheme and references EIP-3155 for the EVM trace specification.
