EIP-3675 proposes to upgrade the consensus mechanism on Ethereum Mainnet from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) driven by the beacon chain. The beacon chain network has been running without failure since December 2020, demonstrating the sustainability and readiness of the system to become a security provider for Ethereum Mainnet. The EIP specifies changes to the block structure, block processing, fork choice rule, and network interface introduced by the consensus upgrade. The motivation for introducing PoS is explained in EIP-2982. The EIP also discusses other topics such as the reduction of ether issuance, advantages of PoW mining, recovery forks, and other public goods.
