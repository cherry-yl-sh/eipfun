ERC-6327, titled "Elastic Signature," proposes a new interface for Ethereum wallets that allows users to sign transactions using a password instead of a private key. This proposal aims to improve user experience and security.

The proposal introduces a new interface, IElasticSignature, which includes functions like resetPassword, verify, and pwdhashOf. The resetPassword function allows users to change their password, while the verify function verifies a proof for a given user. The pwdhashOf function retrieves the password hash for a user.

The document also discusses the rationale behind not using a private key for signing transactions. It argues that a password is more secure than a private key as the difficulty of cracking a password is higher than that of a private key, given a sufficiently long and complex password.

The proposal also acknowledges potential security considerations, including the risk of password cracking. It provides an estimate of the time required to crack a password based on its complexity and length.

The document mentions that there are no known backward compatibility issues associated with this proposal. The test cases, reference implementation, and security considerations are yet to be determined.
