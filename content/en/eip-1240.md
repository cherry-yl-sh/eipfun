EIP-1240 proposes to remove the difficulty bomb in Ethereum, which is causing block times to increase, and replace it with a fixed difficulty targeting 15 second blocks. This change will allow economic participants to decide whether they want to use the new Casper features or continue running unpatched clients. The proposal is not forward compatible and introduces backwards incompatibilities, so it should be included in a scheduled hardfork at a certain block number.
