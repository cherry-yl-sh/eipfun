The EIP-2972 proposal suggests a way to wrap legacy transactions in a typed transaction envelope, allowing them to be processed by Ethereum clients that only support typed transactions. This would make it easier for clients to deal with typed transactions in blocks by deprecating legacy transactions. The new transactions are signature compatible with legacy transactions, and legacy transactions can be decoded and then encoded as type 0 or type 1 transactions. The proposal does not introduce any deprecation process for legacy encoded transactions, but client developers are encouraged to upgrade legacy encoded transactions to typed transactions as soon as it is reasonable. The proposal also includes security considerations, such as excluding transaction types 0xc0 to 0xfe from valid transaction types to avoid conflicts with future transaction types. The proposal does not include any test cases or implementation details.
