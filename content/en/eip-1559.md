## Summary

The EIP-1559 proposal introduces a new transaction pricing mechanism for the Ethereum 1.0 chain that includes a fixed-per-block network fee that is burned and dynamically adjusts block sizes to deal with congestion. The proposal aims to address the inefficiencies of the current first price auction system, which often leads to fee overpayment and complex fee estimation algorithms. The new system starts with a base fee amount that is adjusted up and down by the protocol based on network congestion, with wallets auto-setting gas fees for users in a reliable fashion. Miners only get to keep the priority fee, while the base fee is always burned, ensuring that only ETH can be used to pay for transactions on Ethereum and reducing risks associated with miner extractable value. The proposal also addresses the instability of blockchains with no block reward by counterbalancing Ethereum inflation while still giving the block reward and priority fee to miners. However, the ETH burn precludes a fixed Ether supply, which could result in economic instability as the long term supply of ETH will no longer be constant over time. It is difficult to quantify the impact of this change, as it depends on user demand for block space and whether more ETH is burned on base fee than is generated in mining rewards. Overall, the EIP-1559 proposal aims to improve the efficiency and reliability of the fee market on the Ethereum 1.0 chain.
