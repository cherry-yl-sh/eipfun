The ERC-5679 proposal introduces a consistent way to extend token standards for minting and burning. Minting and burning are typical actions for creating and destroying tokens, and by establishing a consistent way to do so, the basic lifecycle of tokens is completed. The proposal specifies that any contract complying with EIP-20 or EIP-721 when extended with this EIP must implement the mint and burn functions. The access controls of minting and burning usually follow different rules than transfer, so creating separate methods for burning and minting simplifies implementations and reduces security errors. The proposal also includes a table of contents, abstract, motivation, specification, rationale, backwards compatibility, security considerations, and copyright information.
