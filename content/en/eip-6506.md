## Summary

ERC-6506 proposes a standard interface for building contracts that escrow funds based on an account taking action in a DAO. The contract facilitates the exchange of a governance-incentive for users to vote in a designated direction on a DAO-proposal while escrowing funds until the vote can be verified. The motivation behind this proposal is to address the problems with current bribe systems for votes based on pro-rata distribution, which are economically inefficient and result in worse outcomes for voters. The proposal suggests using OTC mechanisms that are more efficient because the amount is "locked in" when the bribe is made and the recipient has much more concrete assurances on which to base their decision. The proposal also addresses potential ethical issues and suggests that the question is not whether it is ethical to encourage users to send/solicit, but rather the consequences of doing nothing. The proposal highlights the potential outcomes of doing nothing, including the flywheel effect and lack of transparency. The proposal is intended to work with existing governance systems and any potential issue with existing governance may represent a potential attack on this as well. The proposal suggests that all systems in which this EIP is integrated with should be properly audited for maximum security.
