ERC-205 is an Ethereum Improvement Proposal that suggests a mechanism for storing ABI definitions in ENS (Ethereum Name Service) to make it easier for callers to interact with contracts. ABIs are metadata that are required for interacting with most contracts, and they are typically supplied out-of-band, which adds an additional burden to interacting with contracts, particularly on a one-off basis or where the ABI may be updated over time. ERC-205 proposes storing ABIs in ENS, which would permit name lookup and ABI discovery via the same process. The proposal defines a resolver profile for retrieving contract ABIs, as well as encoding standards for storing ABIs for different applications, allowing the user to select between different representations based on their need for compactness and other considerations such as onchain access. The proposal also permits different names to provide different ABIs for the same contract, and it specifies ABIs for contracts that did not specify one of their own. The fallback to looking up an ABI on the reverse record permits contracts to specify their own canonical ABI, and prevents the need for duplication when multiple names reference the same contract without the need for different ABIs. Overall, ERC-205 aims to simplify the process of interacting with contracts by making ABIs more easily accessible through ENS.
