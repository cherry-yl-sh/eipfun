ERC-5313 is a specification that defines the minimum interface required to identify an account that controls a contract. It is a slimmed-down alternative to EIP-173 and is intended to minimize the number of functions in the interface while maintaining backwards compatibility with existing contracts. The key function in this interface is "owner", which returns the address of the owner of the contract. However, because this specification does not extend EIP-165, calling this EIPâ€™s owner function cannot result in complete certainty that the result is indeed the owner. This means that if the interrogator is sending a valuable NFT to the identified owner of any contract on the network, then the risk is heightened. The standard can be (and has been) extended by other standards to add additional ownership functionality. Implementing EIP-165 could be a valuable addition to this interface specification, but this EIP is being written to codify existing protocols that connect contracts (often NFTs), with third-party websites (often a well-known NFT marketplace). Every contract that implements EIP-173 already implements this specification.
