The EIP-2515 proposal suggests implementing a Difficulty Freeze as an alternative to the current Difficulty Bomb in Ethereum's difficulty adjustment algorithm. The Difficulty Freeze would begin at a predetermined block height and freeze the difficulty, increasing by 1% after that block indefinitely. This would incentivize developers to upgrade regularly and require any chain split to address the difficulty freeze. The proposal argues that the current difficulty bomb is complex to model and has negatively affected miners and users in the past. The Difficulty Freeze would be more predictable and the consequences of missing it would be more directly felt by client maintainers, who are better positioned to respond to it. The proposal includes adding a variable for DIFFICULTY_FREEZE_HEIGHT and defines the logic of the Difficulty Freeze. An optional implementation includes adding the variable DIFFICULTY_FREEZE_DIFFERENCE and using LAST_FORK_HEIGHT to calculate when the Difficulty Freeze would occur.
