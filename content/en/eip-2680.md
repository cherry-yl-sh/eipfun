The ERC-2680 proposal defines a standard layout and naming format for walletstore and keystore for both hierarchical and non-hierarchical storage systems in Ethereum 2. Currently, there are no standards for the layout of Ethereum wallets in persistent storage, which makes different wallet implementations incompatible. This proposal aims to address this issue by defining a standard placement for Ethereum walletstores and keystores, making it possible for different software to work with the same wallets and keys. The proposal specifies four elements for a wallet that need to be addressed: base location, wallet container, walletstore, and keystore. The base location is required to be well-known, either pre-defined or defined by the storage system's connection parameters. The proposal also provides pre-defined base locations for different operating systems. The introduction of another derivation path requires existing software to add support for this scheme in addition to any existing schemes. The proposal aims to improve interoperability between validators, allowing users to move from one validator software to another without requiring movement of files, which could cause loss of access to funds. The proposal does not have any implementation yet, and test cases are to be determined.
