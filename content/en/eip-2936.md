EIP-2936 proposes a new opcode, EXTCLEAR, to clear storage for SELFDESTRUCTed contracts. Currently, when a contract is self-destructed, its storage is also cleared. However, this proposal suggests deferring the time of storage cleanup and leaving the storage in place, which reduces the complexity of SLOAD and SELFDESTRUCT. The new opcode, EXTCLEAR, will clear a specific storage slot for a contract that has previously been self-destructed. This empowers the CREATE2 reincarnation proxy pattern by retaining storage during upgrade, which would otherwise have to be reset again. The proposal also modifies the SELFDESTRUCT opcode to not clear contract storage. This change works retroactively, meaning all prior destroyed contracts can be cleaned up. The proposal also includes information on gas costs and security considerations. Implementation is required on all major clients to add the opcode. Overall, this proposal aims to improve the efficiency and flexibility of contract upgrades by allowing for the retention of storage during upgrades.
