ERC-3135, titled "Exclusive Claimable Token," proposes a token that can be claimed only by the token issuer with the payer's signature. This standard aims to establish micropayment channels between service providers and any number of users by signing and verifying messages about token consumption off-chain. This mechanism reduces interactions with the blockchain, saving gas and improving performance.rnrnThe standard introduces several new functions, including withdraw, depositBalanceOf, and events like Deposit, Withdraw, TransferIssuer, and Claim. The withdraw function can be executed differently based on business models, such as the prepayment model and the lock-release model.rnrnIn the prepayment model, the user pays (crypto)currency to the store in advance for claimable tokens. When checking out, the customer signs a message with updated consumption to the store, and the store verifies this message off-chain. In the lock-release model, the counting of services happens on both client and server side. The client should not trust the charge amount given by the server in case it's malfunctioning or malicious.rnrnThe standard also discusses the signature generation process, the verification process, and security considerations, including the potential for double-spending problems.
