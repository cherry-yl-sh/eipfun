The ERC-6806 proposal is an extension of the ERC-721 standard in Ethereum that adds an interface to track and describe the holding time of a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) by an account. The motivation behind this proposal is to provide valuable information about the duration for which a NFT has been held by an account, which can be useful for rewarding long-term holders, determining access to exclusive content, or implementing specific business logic based on holding time. The proposal includes a new function called getHoldingInfo, which returns the address of the holder and the holding time for a given NFT token ID. The proposal also includes an interface that extends the existing ERC-721 standard. The proposal does not have any backward compatibility issues and the security considerations of ERC-721 and ERC-1046 apply. The proposal was drafted by Saitama, Combo, and Luigi and was published on the Ethereum Magicians forum on March 30, 2023.
