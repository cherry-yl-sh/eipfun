ERC-5606 proposes a standard for creating a multiverse NFT, which is a universal representation of multiple related NFTs as a single digital asset across various platforms. This standard allows for the indexing and ownership of a digital asset across various platforms, such as metaverses, play-to-earn games, or NFT marketplaces. It extends the ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards and allows for the bundling and unbundling of delegate NFTs within the multiverse NFT, so holders can trade them individually or as a bundle. The motivation behind this proposal is to address the lack of interoperability between platforms that use NFT standards and to prove the scarcity of digital assets on-chain. The proposal was authored by Gaurang Torvekar, Khemraj Adhawade, and Nikhil Asrani and was published on September 6, 2022.
