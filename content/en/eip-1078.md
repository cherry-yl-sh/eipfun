ERC-1078 is a proposed Ethereum Improvement Proposal that presents a method to replace the usual signup/login design pattern with a minimal ethereum native scheme, that doesnât require passwords, backing up private keys nor typing seed phrases. It relates to universal login and signup using ENS subdomains on the Ethereum network by using a unique identifier of the user as a contract which implements both Identity and the Executable Signed Messages ERCs, and the user only needs to provide an ENS name pointing to it instead of the contract address directly. The login process involves requesting a name from the user and generating a private key locally to request authorization to add that key as one of the signers of that identity, with a given set of permissions.
