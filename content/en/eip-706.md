EIP-706 proposes a small extension to the DEVp2p protocol used by Ethereum to enable Snappy compression on all message payloads after the initial handshake. This is aimed at reducing the amount of bandwidth wasted in the network, making both initial sync and normal operation faster and less laggy. The proposal suggests bumping the advertised DEVp2p version number from 4 to 5 and injecting a Snappy compression step right before encrypting the DEVp2p message during sending. This would enable compression for all sub-protocols (eth, les, bzz) seamlessly, reducing any complexity those protocols might incur in trying to individually optimize for data traffic. After extensive benchmarks, results show that data traffic is decreased by 60-80% for initial sync. The proposal also includes test vectors for implementation in Go and Python.
