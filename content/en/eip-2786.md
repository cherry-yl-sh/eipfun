## Summary

EIP-2786 proposes that when an Ethereum Provider becomes connected or disconnected, it should emit a connect/disconnect event. The Provider is considered connected when it can service RPC requests to at least one chain, and disconnected when it cannot service RPC requests to any chain. The connect event is emitted when the Provider switches from a connected state to a disconnected state, and the disconnect event is emitted when the Provider switches from a disconnected state to a connected state. The motivation behind this proposal is to alert applications of connect/disconnect events so that they can appropriately inform the user of the situation. It is up to the application to decide whether to listen in on these events and how to handle them. The EIP is mostly retrospective, meaning it codifies an already existing specification, and there isn't much room for improvement. The relationship between Ethereum Provider and client is a trusted one, where it is assumed that the user implicitly trusts the Ethereum Provider, which is how it managed to get injected into the client, or the client expressly pulled in a connection to it.
