EIP-2026 proposes a fixed prepayment for creating new accounts in Ethereum, both for contracts and non-contracts. This prepayment is added to a new field called rentbalance, which becomes part of the state. The motivation behind this change is to address shortcomings of simply raising the gas cost of account creation, such as the inability to recycle prepayments via mining and the potential for miners to circumvent the penalty. The prepayment will be used to cover state rent in the future and will allow newly created contracts with no endowment to not be evicted in the same block. Prepayments on pre-existing accounts are also necessary to prevent hoarding of accounts ahead of this change. The proposal is part of the State Rent roadmap and is intended to put a bound on the number of accounts that can be created, as the fixed charge cannot be recycled via mining.
