## Summary

EIP-2027 proposes a change to the way Ethereum tracks the number of storage slots filled and emptied in contracts. Currently, only the net change in the number of slots is tracked, but this proposal introduces initial, net accounting of the number of contract storage slots. This change is part of the State Rent roadmap and will make it possible to introduce gross accounting of the number of storage slots, which will be useful for various purposes. For example, gas costs of operations such as SLOAD and SSTORE will need to be increased to compensate for extra bandwidth consumed by the block proofs. Additionally, snapshot sync protocols will benefit from having the correct size of the contract storage present in the state. The proposal specifies that if the previous value of a location is 0 and the new value is not 0, the storagesize will be incremented. The proposal also includes information on the semantics of increment and decrement storagesize and a note on HUGE_NUMBER.
