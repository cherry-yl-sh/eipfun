The ERC-5646 proposal is a standard for creating an unambiguous identifier for the state of a mutable token without needing knowledge of its implementation details. It defines the minimum interface required to identify the state of a token and includes a function called getStateFingerprint, which returns a unique value for each token state. The function takes in the token ID as a parameter and returns a bytes32 value that includes all state properties that might change during the token lifecycle, as well as computed values and token metadata URI. The proposal also specifies that getStateFingerprint should not return a different value when the token state remains the same and should include all state properties that might change during the token lifecycle. Additionally, the proposal includes a requirement that supportsInterface(0xf5112315) must return true. The motivation behind this proposal is to avoid the bottleneck problem that arises when protocols need to support every new token specifically. By using state fingerprints as part of a token identifier, protocols can support mutable tokens without needing knowledge of their implementation details. The proposal is not intended for use cases where token state property knowledge is required, as these cases cannot escape the bottleneck problem.
