## Summary

The EIP-214 proposal is a proposal to increase smart contract security by adding a new opcode called STATICCALL. This opcode can be used to call another contract (or itself) while disallowing any modifications to the state during the call (and its subcalls, if present). This allows contracts to make calls that are clearly non-state-changing, making it easier to implement purely functional high-level languages. The proposal is backwards compatible and does not modify the behavior of other opcodes. The new opcode is introduced with the value 0xfa and functions equivalently to a CALL, except it takes only 6 arguments and calls the child with the STATIC flag set to true for the execution of the child. Once this call returns, the flag is reset to its value before the call.
