The ERC-5219 proposal is a standard interface for making resource requests to smart contracts and receiving HTTP-like responses on the Ethereum network. The motivation behind this proposal is to address the issue of DApps not being fully decentralized, as users currently need to access a centralized website containing the DApp's front-end code to interface with it. This presents risks such as trust minimization, censorship, and lack of permanence. The ERC-5219 proposal aims to provide a solution to this problem by allowing DApps to directly interact with smart contracts, without the need for a centralized website. 

The proposal recommends separating the application logic from the front-end logic and specifies that DApp contracts must implement the interface defined in the Contract Interface file. It also provides guidelines for name resolution and notes to implementers. 

Overall, the ERC-5219 proposal aims to improve the decentralization and interoperability of DApps on the Ethereum network by standardizing the way resource requests are made to smart contracts.
