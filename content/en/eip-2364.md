EIP-2364 proposes the inclusion of the forkid, which was originally defined in EIP-2124, as a new field in the Ethereum wire protocol (eth) handshake. This change is implemented as a new version of the wire protocol, eth/64. The forkid allows two Ethereum nodes to quickly and cheaply decide if they are compatible or not, not only at a genesis/networking level, but also from the perspective of the currently passed network updates (i.e. forks). By cross-validating forkid during the handshake, incompatible nodes can disconnect before expensive block exchanges and validations take place, preventing peer slots from being taken up by nodes that are incompatible but have not yet been detected as such. The proposal does not remove the genesisHash field from the eth handshake, as the genesis hash may be useful for other things too, not just connection filtering. The proposal is backwards compatible and does not require a hard fork. Test cases for calculating and validating fork IDs are provided in EIP-2124. There are no security considerations for this proposal.
