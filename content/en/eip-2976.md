EIP-2976 proposes adding support for the transmission of typed transactions over devp2p in Ethereum. This would allow for the gossiping of new transaction types introduced in EIP-2718, which are currently unable to be included in blocks without a mechanism for transmission. The proposal defines TypedTransactions as a byte array containing a TransactionType and TransactionPayload, with TransactionType being a positive unsigned 8-bit number representing the type of the transaction and TransactionPayload being an opaque byte array dependent on the TransactionType. LegacyTransactions are still supported, and a TransactionId is defined as the keccak256 hash of the TypedTransactionHash and LegacyTransactionHash. The proposal also defines TypedReceipts and ReceiptLists. The authors chose not to specify each transaction type at the protocol layer to avoid maintenance burden and instead define that typed transactions are supported. Peers are recommended to disconnect if they receive an unknown transaction type to avoid DoS attacks, but this recommendation can be ignored in limited situations. Overall, the proposal aims to enable the use of new transaction types in Ethereum by updating devp2p to support the gossip of TypedTransactions.
