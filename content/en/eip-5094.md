ERC-5094 proposes a new type of URL for usage with deep-linking, QR, and more, to allow users to seamlessly add new networks to their (for ex. mobile) wallet to then be able to more easily partake in pay-, tx-, or other Ethereum URL interactions. The standard includes all needed information for adding a network to a wallet via URL, by including parameters such as chainId, rpc_url, chain_name and others, such that the network configuration is provided through the URL itself. The specification allows for a multitude of rpc_url and explorer_url to be specified. This is done such to overlap with parsing of the TYPE mentioned in EIP-681. The introduction of this EIP is meant to bridge to a safer RPC listing system to be introduced in the near future. URLs can be malformed to deceive users, so users should confirm the source of the URL before using any links. Applications should display network config prior to network addition, such that users can confirm the validity of the network configuration being added.
