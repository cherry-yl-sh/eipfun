EIP-7045, titled "Increase max attestation inclusion slot," proposes an increase in the maximum attestation inclusion slot from attestation.slot + SLOTS_PER_EPOCH to the last slot of epoch N+1, where N is the epoch containing the attestation slot. This change is crucial for the current LMD-GHOST security analysis and the confirmation rule.

The proposal modifies the process_attestation function to remove the upper bound on the slot check and instead rely on the minimum slot and the target epoch being in either the current or previous epoch. It also modifies the get_attestation_participation_flag_indices function to set the TIMELY_TARGET_FLAG without considering inclusion_delay, ensuring that extended inclusion attestations have a non-zero reward.

The proposal also modifies the attestation and aggregate attestation gossip conditions to allow for gossip during this extended range. The rationale behind this proposal is that extending the max inclusion slot to the end of the next epoch is critical for LMD-GHOST security proofs and confirmation rule.

The document mentions that this proposal introduces backward-incompatible changes to the block validation rule set on the consensus layer and must be accompanied by a hard fork. There are no known negative impacts on security.
