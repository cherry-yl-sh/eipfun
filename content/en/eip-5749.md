The EIP-5749 proposal suggests replacing the current method of interacting with injected wallets, 'window.ethereum', with a new interface called 'window.evmproviders'. This new interface would allow for the interoperability of multiple browser wallets at the same time, improving user experience and encouraging innovation in the space. The current method only permits one wallet to be injected at a time, resulting in a race condition between two or more wallets, which creates an inconsistent connection behavior that makes having and using more than one browser wallet unpredictable and impractical. The proposal aims to foster fairer competition by reducing the barriers to entry for new wallet providers, along with enhancing the user experience on Ethereum networks. The proposal introduces a set of window events to provide a two-way communication protocol between Ethereum libraries and injected scripts provided by browser extensions, enabling users to select their wallet of choice. Each wallet provider will be announced with a unique identifier, a locally unique identifier, a human-readable name, and an icon. The wallet provider will also announce their own EIP-1193 provider interface in parallel with the provider info defined above. The proposal also includes security considerations, such as rendering SVG images using the <img> tag to ensure no JS executions can happen.
