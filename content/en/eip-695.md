## Summary

The EIP-695 proposal is to create the `eth_chainId` method for JSON-RPC, which should return a single STRING result for an integer value in hexadecimal format, describing the currently configured CHAIN_ID value used for signing replay-protected transactions, introduced by EIP-155. Its purpose is to allow for querying the chain ID, which is critical in replay attack prevention, and to reliably identify the chain being communicated with.
