The ERC-6268 proposal is an extension of the EIP-1155 standard for indicating the transferability of tokens. It standardizes an interface for indicating non-transferability of semi-fungible or fungible tokens, specifically Soulbound Tokens (SBT). The proposal requires smart contracts implementing this standard to conform to the EIP-1155 specification, implement all functions in the IERC6268 interface, and implement the EIP-165 supportsInterface function. For tokens marked as locked, the locked(_id) function must return true and any functions attempting to transfer the token must throw an error. The proposal aims to promote the usage of Soulbound semi-fungible or fungible tokens by introducing a standard non-transferability indicator that is agnostic to fungibility.
