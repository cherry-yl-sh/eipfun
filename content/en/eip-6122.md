The EIP-6122 proposal modifies the forkid checks used to identify nodes on the Ethereum p2p network based on their chain configuration. Previously, forks were scheduled by block number, but after the merge, forks will be scheduled by block time. This EIP updates the forkid calculation to include block time in addition to block number. Each node maintains a value called FORK_HASH, which is an IEEE CRC32 checksum of the genesis hash and fork blocks numbers or timestamps that have already passed. The fork block numbers or timestamps are fed into the CRC32 checksum in ascending order, and if multiple forks are applied at the same block or time, the block number or timestamp is checksummed only once. Block numbers and timestamps are encoded in big endian format when checksumming. The forkid calculation allows peers to quickly determine the configuration of peers and disconnect peers that are misconfigured or configured for other networks. This proposal aims to make the p2p network more reliable by allowing nodes to cut off incompatible nodes quickly.
