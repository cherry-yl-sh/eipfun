The EIP-5656 proposal introduces a new memory copying instruction called MCOPY, which aims to provide an efficient way to copy memory areas on the EVM. The motivation behind this proposal is to reduce the overhead associated with memory copying, which is a basic operation but can be costly on the EVM. The proposal suggests that MCOPY can significantly improve the performance of memory copying, especially for languages like Solidity and Vyper, where memory copying is used extensively. The potential impact of this proposal is that it can make building data structures and computationally heavy operations more efficient on Ethereum, while also providing forward protection against future gas cost changes to CALL instructions.
