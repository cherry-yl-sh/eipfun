The ERC-5189 proposal suggests a way to implement account abstraction without making changes to the consensus layer and while maintaining compatibility with existing smart contract wallets. Instead of defining a strict structure for meta-transactions, the proposal introduces the concept of endorser contracts. These smart contract instances are responsible for determining the quality of submitted meta-transactions, thus helping bundlers decide whether to keep a meta-transaction in the mempool or not. Developers who want to make their smart contract wallet compatible with this proposal must create and deploy an instance of an endorser, which must be seeded with a small amount of ETH to incentivize good behavior. The proposal aims to achieve the primary goal of account abstraction, which is to allow users to use smart contract wallets containing arbitrary verification and execution logic instead of externally owned accounts (EOAs) as their primary account. It also aims to support existing smart contract wallet implementations, work with all activity happening over a public mempool, and avoid trust assumptions between bundlers, developers, and wallets. The proposal is designed to accommodate almost all possible variations of smart contract wallets and to maintain a healthy mempool without risking its participants from getting flooded with invalid or malicious payloads.
