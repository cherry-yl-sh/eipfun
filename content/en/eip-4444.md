The EIP-4444 proposal aims to limit the amount of historical data that execution clients need to store in order to reduce their storage requirements. This is achieved by setting a bound on the amount of historical data that clients need to store, with older data being deleted as new data is added. The proposal acknowledges that this may lead to more dapps relying on centralized services for acquiring historical data, but recommends implementing EIP-4444 or a similar history expiry proposal to mitigate this risk. The proposal does not increase the burst data capacity of the chain, but does increase the average data capacity, which could lead to increased storage requirements for history-storing. The proposal recommends implementing EIP-4444 or a similar history expiry proposal to mitigate this risk. The proposal is available for citation on the Ethereum Improvement Proposals website.
