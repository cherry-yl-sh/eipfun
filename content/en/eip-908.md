## Summary

EIP-908 is a proposal to reward clients for developing and maintaining the Ethereum client software. The proposal suggests that clients spend significantly more time and resources on developing and maintaining the client than full node operators spend running and maintaining a full node. Therefore, the initial suggestion for the ratio of rewards to the client vs the full node is 99:1. However, further analysis suggests that clients would also benefit from a large volume of rewards from every full node running the client, so the ratio could be adjusted to incentivize full node operation further. 

The proposal acknowledges that providing rewards to full node validators and clients would increase the issuance of Ethereum, so the EIP suggests reducing the mining reward to maintain the issuance at current levels. However, this could generate controversy and discussion. 

One potential point of controversy with rewarding clients and full nodes is that the work previously done by them has not been paid for until now, so existing clients may argue that this EIP gives an advantage to new entrants. However, the proposal argues that existing clients have the first mover advantage, with much development to create useful and well-used products. 

Overall, the EIP-908 proposal aims to incentivize the development and maintenance of the Ethereum client software to ensure a sustainable network. However, the proposal is still in draft form and requires further analysis and discussion before implementation.
