ERC-5773 is a proposed standard for Multi-Asset NFTs that allows for context-dependent output of information per single NFT. This means that the asset in an appropriate format is displayed based on how the token is being accessed. An NFT can have multiple assets (outputs), which can be any kind of file to be served to the consumer, and orders them by priority. They do not have to match in mimetype or tokenURI, nor do they depend on one another. Assets are not standalone entities, but should be thought of as ânamespaced tokenURIsâ that can be ordered at will by the NFT owner, but only modified, updated, added, or removed if agreed on by both the owner of the token and the issuer of the token. The standard is motivated by the need for cross-metaverse compatibility, multi-media output, media redundancy, and NFT evolution. The proposal includes a specification, rationale, backwards compatibility, test cases, reference implementation, and security considerations.
