The ERC-3643 proposal is a standard for security tokens on Ethereum that provides interfaces for the management and compliant transfer of security tokens. It is designed to be backwards compatible with ERC-20 and to interact with ERC-735 to validate claims linked to an ONCHAINID. It is specifically aimed at regulated exchanges and includes functions such as forced transfers, freeze tokens, minting, burning, and recovering lost tokens.
