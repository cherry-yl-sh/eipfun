EIP-1716 is a meta-proposal that outlines the changes included in the Ethereum hardfork called Petersburg. This hardfork removes EIP-1283 from the previous hardfork called Constantinople. The activation block for Petersburg is set at Block >= 7_280_000 on the Ethereum Mainnet. The removed EIP-1283 was related to net gas metering for SSTORE without dirty maps and was removed due to a potential reentrancy attack vector. If Petersburg and Constantinople are applied at the same block, Petersburg takes precedence and EIP-1283 is disabled. The proposal was agreed upon at the All-Core-Devs call #53 in January 2019.
