EIP-1965 proposes a method to check if a chainID is valid at a specific block number, which addresses the limitations of the current approach of specifying the chain ID at compile time or accessing the latest chainID. The proposal suggests modifying EIP-1344 to return the block number at which a chainID becomes invalid, but acknowledges that this could be easily ignored by contracts. The proposal assumes that minority-led forks will not gain traction and therefore do not need to be protected. The EIP is fully backwards compatible with all chains that implement EIP-155 chain ID domain separator for transaction signing. The proposal suggests updating EIP-712 to deal with chainID separately from the domain separator and acknowledges that implementing a smart contract-based caching solution as proposed in EIP-1344 comes with a higher gas cost. The proposal addresses the risks associated with using the latest chainID for L2 message verification and emphasizes the importance of ensuring the validity of past chainIDs via a trustless cache implemented via smart contract. Overall, the proposal aims to provide a more secure and reliable method for checking the validity of chainIDs at specific block numbers.
