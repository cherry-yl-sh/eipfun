The ERC-5982 proposal defines an interface for role-based access control for smart contracts in Ethereum. The motivation behind this proposal is to establish a more secure and flexible way of granting permissions to privileged actions, as opposed to ownership-based access control. The interface specifies how to read, grant, create, and destroy roles, which are defined as byte32. It also specifies the sense of role power in the format of its ability to call a given method identified by bytes4 method selector. Additionally, the interface specifies how metadata of roles are represented. The proposal includes two interfaces: IERC_ACL_CORE and IERC_ACL_GENERAL. The former includes functions for checking if an account has a certain role, granting a role to an account, and revoking a role from an account. The latter includes an event for when a role is granted. The proposal is currently in the process of being peer-reviewed and interested parties are encouraged to participate in the discussion. The proposal references other Ethereum Improvement Proposals, including EIP-2930, which proposes optional access lists, ERC-3009, which proposes transfer with authorization, and ERC-6909, which proposes a minimal multi-token interface.
