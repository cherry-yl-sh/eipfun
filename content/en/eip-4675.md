ERC-4675, titled "Multi-Fractional Non-Fungible Tokens," proposes a smart contract interface that can represent any number of fractionalized non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The standard allows each token ID to represent a token type that fractionalizes the NFT. This approach contrasts with conventional methods that deploy separate ERC-20 compatible token contracts to fractionalize NFTs into fungible tokens (FTs).rnrnThe proposal includes several functions such as transfer, approve, transferFrom, and setParentNFT, which handle the transfer of tokens, approval of token withdrawal, and the registration of NFTs as new token types, respectively.rnrnThe standard also introduces events like Transfer, Approval, and TokenAddition to reflect changes in token ownership, approval status, and the addition of new token types.rnrnThe document emphasizes that this standard is designed to be flexible for diverse token designs and architectures. It also mentions that it is compatible with existing standards, with event and function names identical to the ERC-20 token standard and a similar use of _id for distinguishing token types as in ERC-1155.rnrnThe standard is intended to interact with the EIP-721 Non-Fungible Token Standard and is kept purposefully agnostic to extensions beyond the standard to allow specific projects to design their own token usage and scenarios. The test cases, reference implementation, and security considerations are yet to be determined.
