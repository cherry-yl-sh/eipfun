## Summary

EIP-2593 proposes a new fee market mechanism for the Ethereum 1.0 chain that replaces the current first-price auction model. The proposal suggests a base fee amount that is adjusted up and down by the protocol based on network congestion. When the network exceeds the target per-block gas usage, the base fee increases slightly and when capacity is below the target, it decreases slightly. This allows wallets to auto-set gas fees for users in a highly reliable fashion, and it is expected that most users will not have to manually adjust gas fees, even in periods of high network activity. The proposal also includes a small priority fee that compensates miners taking on orphan risk, which is automatically set. Users can manually set the transaction max fee to bound their total costs. An important aspect of this fee system is that miners only get to keep the priority fee, while the base fee is always burned by the protocol. This ensures that only ETH can ever be used to pay for transactions on Ethereum, reducing risks associated with miner extractable value (MEV) and cementing the economic value of ETH within the Ethereum platform. The proposal aims to create highly efficient price discovery, where the price will always immediately fall to the highest bid price, which is not necessarily that userâs highest price they would pay.
