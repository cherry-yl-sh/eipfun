## Summary

The ERC-4524 proposal aims to extend the ERC-20 standard by adding EIP-165 and familiar functions from ERC-721 and ERC-1155. This allows for the ability to check if a target recipient explicitly signals compatibility with an ERC, which is already used in NFT standards. The proposal also suggests the inclusion of a metadata URI for tokens, but this has not been included to keep the proposal minimal and because it is already covered by EIP-1046. There are no issues with backwards compatibility, and test cases and a reference implementation have been provided. However, care should be taken with the callback function onERC20Received to avoid vulnerabilities. The motivation behind this proposal is to bring innovations from NFT standards back to ERC-20 and make it easier for app developers to integrate newer innovations built atop these standards. The proposal is summarized in less than 300 words.
