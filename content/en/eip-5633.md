The ERC-5633 proposal is an extension of EIP-1155 that proposes a smart contract interface for representing both soulbound and non-soulbound NFTs. Soulbound is a property of a token that prevents it from being transferred between accounts. This proposal provides a standard way to represent soulbound NFTs that can coexist with non-soulbound ones. Each token ID can have its own soulbound property. The proposal outlines an interface to EIP-1155 that allows wallet implementers and developers to check for the soulbound property of a token ID using EIP-165. The transfer function can only be called when the token is not soulbound. The motivation for this proposal is the increasing interest in soulbound NFTs similar to World of Warcraft's soulbound items. This proposal makes it easy to design composable NFTs for an entire collection in a single contract. The proposal includes sections on specification, rationale, backwards compatibility, test cases, reference implementation, security considerations, and copyright.
