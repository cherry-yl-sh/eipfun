The ERC-5023 proposal standardizes an interface for creating non-fungible value-holding tokens that can be shared by multiple owners. This is accomplished by minting copies of existing tokens for new recipients, allowing for the construction of a graph describing who has shared what to which party. The motivation behind this proposal is to capture positive externalities in ecosystems with new types of incentive mechanisms that exhibit anti-rival logic, serve as a unit of accounting, and function as a medium of sharing. The proposal also includes a variation of shareable NFTs called non-transferable shareable NFTs, which can be shared at almost zero technical transaction cost. The specification includes the need for third parties to be able to distinguish re-fungible tokens from other token standards and to determine when a non-fungible token is collectively owned. This is useful for price discovery of the underlying asset, liquidity for shared owners, and as a new class of asset which can be used as collateral for loans or other financial instruments like stable coins. The proposal references the ERC-1948 Non-fungible Data Token for initial contact with the re-fungible token.
