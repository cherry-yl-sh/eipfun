EIP-3540 proposes a new container format for EVM bytecode called EOF, which separates code and data and allows for versioning and easy introduction of changes. The format includes a once-off validation at deploy time, which can result in gas savings and ease of use for on-chain code validators and analysis tools. The proposed changes that could benefit from this format include introducing a JUMPDEST-table, static jumps and jump tables, requiring a terminating instruction at the end of a code section, multibyte opcodes, representing functions as individual code sections, and introducing special sections for Account Abstraction. The format is extensible and versioned, and relies on the reserved byte introduced by EIP-3541. The document includes a specification with key words interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174. The EIP is currently in the process of being peer-reviewed.
