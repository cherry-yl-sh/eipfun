The ERC-5218 proposal is an interface for creating copyright licenses that transfer with an NFT. It provides a structured framework for recording licensing details and allows NFT creators to give the NFT holder a copyright license to use a work associated with the NFT. The holder of an active license can issue sublicenses to others to carry out the rights granted under the license. The license can be transferred with the NFT, so do all the sublicenses. The license can optionally be revoked under conditions specified by the creator. The proposal aims to address the issue of uncertainty about rights to use the work associated with the NFT, which is a common problem in NFT projects involving creative works. The proposal does not define the legal details of the license but provides basic functionality to create, transfer, and revoke licenses, and to determine the current licensing state of an NFT. The proposal was authored by James Grimmelmann, Yan Ji, and Tyler Kell and was published on July 11, 2022.
