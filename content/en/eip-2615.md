The ERC-2615 proposal is an extension to the ERC721 Non-Fungible Token (NFT) standard in Ethereum that introduces mortgage and rental functions for NFTs. This allows NFT owners to rent out their NFTs and take out a mortgage by collateralizing their NFTs, which can apply to virtual items, physical items, intellectual property rights, and DAO membership tokens. The proposal introduces additional roles, such as the right of tenants to enable rentals and the right of lien. 

The motivation behind this proposal is to address the challenges of implementing rental and mortgage functions with the ERC721 standard, which only has one role defined (the owner). To achieve trustless rental of NFTs with ERC721, it has been necessary to deposit funds as security, which is required to prevent malicious activity from tenants. With ERC-2615, security deposits are no longer needed since the standard natively supports rental and tenantship functions. 

In addition, taking out a mortgage on NFTs has required transferring the NFTs to a contract as collateral, which hurts the utility of the NFT. With ERC-2615, it is possible to collateralize NFTs and use them at the same time. The proposal is also open-source and fully backwards-compatible with the ERC721 standard, making it easy for developers to adopt the standard quickly. 

Overall, the ERC-2615 proposal introduces important functionality for NFTs to emulate real property, just like those in the real world.
