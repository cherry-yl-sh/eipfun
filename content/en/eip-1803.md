## Summary

EIP-1803 is a proposal to rename certain opcodes in Ethereum for clarity. The proposal suggests renaming BALANCE to EXTBALANCE, SHA3 to KECCAK256, NUMBER to BLOCKNUMBER, GASLIMIT to BLOCKGASLIMIT, GAS to GASLEFT, and INVALID to ABORT. The purpose of these renamings is to make the opcodes more descriptive and easier to understand for developers. The proposal notes that this will not affect any existing code, but may influence the mnemonics used by assemblers. The proposal references previous renamings of opcodes in EIP-6 and EIP-59. Overall, the proposal aims to improve the clarity and usability of Ethereum's opcode system.
