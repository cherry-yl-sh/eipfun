EIP-5 is a proposal for improving the gas usage for `RETURN` and `CALL*` in the Ethereum network. Currently, when a contract or function is called from within the Ethereum Virtual Machine, the size of the output has to be specified in advance. This makes returning dynamically-sized data both costly and inflexible, as gas has to be paid for memory that is not written to. nnThe proposed solution in EIP-5 is to charge gas only for memory that is actually written to at the time the `CALL` returns. This means that if the called contract returns data of size n, the memory of the calling contract is grown to output_start + min(output_size, n) (and the calling contract is charged gas for that) and the output is written to the area [output_start, output_start + min(n, output_size)). nnThe gas and memory semantics for `CALL`, `CALLCODE`, and `DELEGATECALL` are changed in the following way: gas for growing memory is only charged for input_start + input_size, but not for output_start + output_size. The calling contract can run out of gas both at the beginning of the opcode and at the end of the opcode. After the call, the MSIZE opcode should return the size the memory was actually grown to. nnThis proposal is important because it makes it possible to call functions that return strings and other dynamically-sized arrays, which was previously difficult and costly. It also improves the flexibility and usability of the Ethereum network by reducing the cost of returning dynamically-sized data. nnOverall, EIP-5 is a significant improvement to the gas usage for `RETURN` and `CALL*` in the Ethereum network, making it easier and more cost-effective to work with dynamically-sized data.
