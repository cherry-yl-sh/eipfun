## Summary

EIP-2046 proposes to reduce the gas cost of calling precompiled contracts using STATICCALL from 700 to 40, which should allow more efficient use of precompiles as well as precompiles with a total cost below 700. This change is backwards compatible and should not affect contracts created and deployed before the Byzantium hard fork. The cost reduction is not proposed to be reduced to 0 to prevent malicious proxy contracts from doing any state changing operation.
