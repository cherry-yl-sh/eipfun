The EIP-234 proposal suggests adding an optional parameter called `blockHash` to the JSON-RPC filter options used by `eth_newFilter` and `eth_getLogs`. This parameter would allow clients to fetch logs for specific blocks, even if those blocks were not in the current main chain. This would resolve issues related to chain reorgs, unreliable network connections, and insufficient details in the empty case. The Ethereum node responding to the request would either send an error if the block hash was not found or return the results matching the filter constrained to the block provided. This parameter would function similarly to the `fromBlock` and `toBlock` filter options. The proposal was made in March 2017 by Micah Zoltu and is part of the Ethereum Improvement Proposals.
