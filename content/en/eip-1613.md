ERC-1613 proposes the Gas Stations Network, which aims to make smart contracts accessible to non-ether users by allowing contracts to accept "collect-calls" and incentivizing nodes to run "gas stations" to facilitate this. Currently, communicating with dapps requires paying ETH for gas, which limits dapp adoption to ether users. The Gas Stations Network abstracts the implementation details from both the dapp maintainer and the user, making it easy to convert existing dapps to accept "collect-calls". The network consists of a single public contract trusted by all participating dapp contracts and a decentralized network of relay nodes (gas stations) incentivized to listen on non-ether interfaces such as web or whisper, pay for transactions, and get compensated by that contract. Gas stations cannot censor transactions as long as there's at least one honest gas station, and attempts to undermine the system can be proven on-chain and offenders can be penalized. Dapps adding gas station network support remain backwards compatible with their existing apps/users, and the added methods apply on top of the existing ones, so no changes are required for existing apps.
