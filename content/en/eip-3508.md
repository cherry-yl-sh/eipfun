The proposal in EIP-3508 is to introduce an ORIGIN-prefixed instruction set that would enable smart contract systems to acquire access to the original transaction data at any given step in the call chain execution, which could result in cross-contract calls ultimately consuming less gas if the data passed between them is reduced as a side-effect of this change. This relates to transaction data opcodes in Ethereum because it would allow for more efficient cross-contract interactions by reducing the amount of data passed between contracts. However, the gas reduction would only be applicable for rudimentary memory arguments rather than storage-based data, which is most commonly utilized in these types of calls, so the overall gas reduction observed by this change will be negligible for most implementations.
