## Summary

The ERC-3448 standard is a standard for creating proxy contracts with immutable metadata attached to the bytecode. It defines a minimal bytecode implementation that allows users and third party tools to discover and depend on the behavior of the code at the destination contract as the behavior of the redirecting contract, and to verify/view the attached metadata. The exact bytecode of the MetaProxy contract is provided, wherein the bytes at indices 21-41 are replaced with the 20 byte address of the master functionality contract, and everything after the MetaProxy bytecode can be arbitrary metadata with the last 32 bytes indicating the length of the metadata in bytes. The implementation forwards all calls via DELEGATECALL and handles error return bubbling for revert messages.
