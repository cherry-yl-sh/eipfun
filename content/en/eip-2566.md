## Summary

EIP-2566 proposes a new Ethereum RPC method called eth_sendTransactionToContractFunction that allows for human-readable contract function execution data to be displayed to users. Currently, when a dapp prompts a user to execute a smart contract function via a ProviderWallet, confirmation screens displayed in the ProviderWallet layer cannot display the human-readable details of the function to be called and the arguments to be passed. This is because the Ethereum RPC method used for contract function execution (eth_sendTransaction) accepts information about what function to call in a non-human readable (and non-recoverable) format. As such, when a ProviderWallet receives this non-human-readable information from a dapp, they are unable to display a human-readable version since they never received one and cannot recover one from the data. This creates a poor and potentially dangerous user experience. By adding a new Ethereum RPC method (eth_sendTransactionToContractFunction) that accepts the function ABI, ProviderWallets can recreate and display the human-readable details of contract function execution to users. The motivation behind this proposal is to improve the user experience and provide better information to users about the execution of contract functions they are relying on ProviderWallets to perform.
