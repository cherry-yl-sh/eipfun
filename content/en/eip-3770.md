## Summary

ERC-3770 proposes a new address standard for Ethereum that includes a human-readable prefix to indicate the specific chain the address belongs to, in order to prevent ambiguity and potential loss of funds due to human error. The prefix is separate from EIP-155 chain IDs and is meant to be displayed to users in dApps and wallets. The proposal includes syntax and examples for chain-specific addresses.
