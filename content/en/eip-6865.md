The ERC-6865 proposal suggests a standardized approach for dApps to implement an on-chain view function called visualizeEIP712Message. This function takes an abi encoded EIP-712 payload message as input and returns a universally agreed-upon structured data format that emphasizes the potential impact on usersâ assets. Wallets can then display this structured data in a user-friendly manner, ensuring a consistent experience for end-users when interacting with various dApps and protocols. The motivation behind this proposal is to address the issue of numerous protocols employing distinct EIP-712 schemas, leading to unavoidable inconsistencies across the ecosystem. The proposal aims to enhance scalability, reliability, and maintainability by shifting the responsibility of visualizing EIP-712 payloads from the wallets to the protocols themselves. This will ultimately result in users gaining a clearer understanding of the transactions theyâre signing, leading to increased security and an improved overall user experience within the crypto space. The proposal also includes specifications and guidelines for wallets to follow when implementing this standardized approach.
