ERC-1967 proposes a set of standard storage slots for delegating proxy contracts to store information such as the address of the logic contract they delegate to and other proxy-specific information. Delegating proxies are widely used for upgradeability and gas savings, but the lack of a common interface for obtaining the logic address for a proxy makes it impossible to build common tools that act upon this information. The proposal aims to solve this problem by providing a consistent location for storing proxy information, which allows clients like block explorers to properly extract and show this information to end users, and logic contracts to optionally act upon it. The proposal also addresses security considerations, such as ensuring that trust-minimized proxies do not allow overflows and represent the exact copy of the code in implementation. Overall, the proposal aims to improve the usability and security of delegating proxy contracts in smart contract development.
