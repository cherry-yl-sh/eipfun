The EIP-6913 proposal introduces the SETCODE instruction in Ethereum, which allows for in-place replacement of code in an account without clearing account balance, nonce, or storage. This method is proposed as a better alternative to the soon-to-be-deprecated SELFDESTRUCT method for code replacement. The gas cost of SETCODE is calculated based on the number of bytes in the new code and is comparable to the CREATE operation. The proposal also includes recommendations for security considerations and backwards compatibility.
