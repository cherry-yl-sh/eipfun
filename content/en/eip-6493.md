EIP-6493 defines a signature scheme for Simple Serialize (SSZ) encoded transactions in Ethereum. Existing transaction types are encoded in the RLP format and hashed using keccak256 for signing and generating a unique transaction identifier. However, for new transaction types encoded in SSZ format, it is more idiomatic to base their signature hash and unique identifier on hash_tree_root instead. The EIP specifies that for each SSZ transaction type, there should be an SSZ type that contains all transaction data to be signed, as well as an SSZ type that represents the transaction's signature. The signed transaction combines the unsigned transaction data with its signature. The EIP is currently in the process of being peer-reviewed and interested parties are encouraged to participate in the discussion.
