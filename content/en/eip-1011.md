EIP-1011 is a proposal that specifies a hybrid Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus model for Ethereum main net. The proposal introduces a novel PoS mechanism called Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget (FFG) that is layered on top of the existing PoW mechanics for new block creation using a smart contract. Through the use of Ether deposits, slashing conditions, and a modified fork choice, FFG allows the underlying PoW blockchain to be finalized. This means that the point at which a block has been decided upon by a client to never revert is reached. As network security is greatly shifted from PoW to PoS, PoW block rewards are reduced. The proposal does not contain safety and liveness proofs or validator implementation details, but these can be found in the Casper FFG paper and Validator Implementation Guide respectively. The finality gadget is designed to minimize changes across clients and is implemented within the EVM, so that the contract byte code encapsulates most of the complexity of the fork. The proposal also specifies the parameters for the Casper contract, including EPOCH_LENGTH, which is set to 50 blocks as a balance between time to finality and message overhead. Overall, the EIP-1011 proposal is the first step to transition Ethereum main net from PoW to PoS using a hybrid consensus model.
