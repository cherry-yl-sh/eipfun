The proposal in ERC-3386 is a standard interface for contracts that create generic ERC-20 tokens which derive from a pool of unique ERC-721/ERC-1155 tokens. It outlines a smart contract interface to wrap identifiable tokens with fungible tokens, allowing for derivative ERC-20 tokens to be minted by locking the base ERC-721 non-fungible tokens and ERC-1155 multi tokens into a pool. These derivative tokens can be burned to redeem base tokens out of the pool.
