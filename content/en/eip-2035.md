EIP-2035 proposes to increase the gas cost of EVM opcodes SLOAD and SSTORE to accommodate the extra bandwidth required to propagate block proof together with the block headers and block bodies. This change prepares Ethereum for the introduction of block proofs, which allows any Ethereum node that wishes to receive them to process transactions in the blocks without needing to access the Ethereum state. In most Ethereum nodes, it will speed up the block processing and reduce the memory footprint of such processing. For mining nodes, however, there will be more work to do to construct and transmit the block proofs, so the extra charge (payable to the miners) is introduced. In the first phase, only contract storage will be covered by the block proofs, meaning that the Ethereum nodes will still need access to the accounts in the state, but block proofs will make it optional to have access to contract storage for executing transactions. Therefore, only SSTORE and SLOAD opcodes are affected. The motivation behind this change is to address the concern that opcodes that read the state tree are under-priced relative to other opcodes, which can degrade network performance via transaction spam. The costs have been derived from an updated version of the calculation table used to generate the 1.0 gas costs, and the rules attempt to target a limit of 8 MB of data that needs to be read in order to process a block.
