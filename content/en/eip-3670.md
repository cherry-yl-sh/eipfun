EIP-3670 proposes to introduce code validation for EOF formatted contracts at the time of deployment. This validation will reject contracts that contain truncated PUSH-data or undefined instructions. Legacy bytecode (code which is not EOF formatted) is not affected by this change. The motivation behind this proposal is to bring code validity into consensus, making it easier to reason about bytecode. Additionally, this change will allow for the introduction of new instructions without bumping the EOF version, as undefined instructions will be rejected at deployment. The EOF1 format provides forward compatibility properties, allowing for the introduction of new instructions and optional EOF sections. The specification relies on the notation of initcode, code, and creation as defined by EIP-3540.
