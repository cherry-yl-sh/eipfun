# EIP Fun

Serve EIP builders, scale Ethereum.

## Background: What are EIPs, and why it matters?

Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) describe standards for the Ethereum platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and contract standards.

EIPs are more than standards. They connect the whole ecosystem: EF, Ethereum chain, developers, builders, startups, EIP editors/authors, tech writers, etc.

## Problem

The connections through EIP are weak.

Navigating and understanding the official EIP website (https://eips.ethereum.org/) can be challenging for developers and others (of course, itâ€™s concise). Although there are many informative articles, code examples, and videos about EIPs, the official website cannot include them. And little communication between author/dev/users.

## Solution

Consider EIP Fun is the "layer2" of EIPs, which build a highway in the ecosystem between EF, Ethereum chain, developers, builders, startups, EIP editors/authors, tech writers, etc.

EIP Fun consists of four main parts:

Website: Aggregate high quality & community-generated content, provide advanced EIP search. A better and more powerful version of https://eips.ethereum.org/.

Community: Collaborate with Ethereum communities like Ethereum Cat Herders and Ethereum Magicians Forum to bring more EIP fans into the community

EIP Newsletter: Professional operators will collect valuable information from the community and EIP updates and sending to subscribers to keep updated.

EIP Grants: We are planning to build EIP grant pool for each important EIP. It will be a brand new way to build connections between donors (EF, EIP-based App, Fans, Authors) and EIP promoters (Authors, new startups, developers, tech writers). Funding will flourish and accelerate the EIP ecosystem.

EIP Fun aims to uncover the potential of EIPs, making them more accessible and enjoyable for everyone. By doing so, we hope to advance the growth of the entire ecosystem.

## Current Progress

We have finished the development phrase as promised. Now is in the operation phrase.

We will add more content on the website, generate high-quality newsletter, co-host EIP-related events, etc. 

And this is the reason why we need grant support.
